@1 = ~A demon in Athkatla?

A girl told me today that the city guard supposedly captured a demon at Waukeen's Promenade. They are keeping it in the city prison at the Government district. I should probably check it out. If it really is a demon, keeping it in an ordinary prison could prove dangerous.~
@2 = ~Come on, we gotta go already or we'll be late!~
@3 = ~Oh! My mom would be so mad...~
@4 = ~A demon in Athkatla?

I have yet to see so much as a glimpse of this supposed demon, although I managed to get something out of the guard named Max who was in charge of guarding its cell at the moment. He told me that I would need Form 1567 from Chief Inspector Brega in order to see the "demon".~ 
@5 = ~A demon in Athkatla?

After an in-depth sojourn into the Athkatlan bureaucracy I have finally acquired a filled, signed and stamped form that should allow me access to the "demon" held inside the prison. I hope it proves worth all this...~
@6 = ~You expect me to wear THAT?~
@7 = ~If I put my head in that thing, how am I supposed to see anything?~
@8 = ~I need both of my hands; I'm not going to strap one to that thing.~
@9 = ~No way, that's too big and clumsy for me.~
@10 = ~A demon in Athkatla?

It turned out that the 'demon' was actually a tiefling - someone whose lineage is tainted with fiendish blood, but not really a demon of any kind.~
@11 = ~Amber's lost belongings

Seems like the city guards are not to be trusted; somehow I'm not surprised at all. I have agreed to return to the prison and help Amber retrieve a bracelet of hers that the guards apparently nicked from her belongings.~
@12 = ~Amber's lost belongings

Ed the guard told me that someone named Nick is the guy who handles the prisoners' possessions. He's off duty right now, but according to Ed, he can often be found at the Sea's Bounty Tavern.~
@13 = ~Amber's lost belongings

It seems that the scumbag known as Nick has traded the bracelet forward to a black market thief at the thieves' guild.~
@14 = ~Amber's lost belongings

The black market thief currently in possession of the bracelet asked for the exorbitant amount of 500 gold pieces for the thing. As Amber was adamant that the item must be recovered, I promised to return to the Thieves' Guild immediately after I have gathered the required sum.~
@15 = ~Amber's lost belongings

The black market thief currently in possession of the bracelet asked for the exorbitant amount of 700 gold pieces for the thing. As Amber was adamant that the item must be recovered, I promised to return to the Thieves' Guild immediately after I have gathered the required sum.~
@16 = ~Amber's lost belongings

The black market thief currently in possession of the bracelet asked for the exorbitant amount of 1000 gold pieces for the thing. As Amber was adamant that the item must be recovered, I promised to return to the Thieves' Guild immediately after I have gathered the required sum.~
@17 = ~Amber's lost belongings

The black market thief currently in possession of the bracelet asked for the exorbitant amount of 1500 gold pieces for the thing. As Amber was adamant that the item must be recovered, I promised to return to the Thieves' Guild immediately after I have gathered the required sum.~
@18 = ~Amber's lost belongings

The black market thief currently in possession of the bracelet asked for the exorbitant amount of 2000 gold pieces for the thing. As Amber was adamant that the item must be recovered, I promised to return to the Thieves' Guild immediately after I have gathered the required sum.~
@19 = ~Amber's lost belongings

The black market thief currently in possession of the bracelet asked for the exorbitant amount of 5000 gold pieces for the thing. As Amber was adamant that the item must be recovered, I promised to return to the Thieves' Guild immediately after I have gathered the required sum.~
@20 = ~Amber's lost belongings

I have finally returned Amber's bracelet to her. Seems like a lot of trouble for such a modest item, but apparently the bracelet once belonged to her friend Jill and thus has a great sentimental value to her.~
@21 = ~You start off into the alley indicated by the map and follow the route pointed out by it. You are sure that several of the alleys and street corners you take were not quite like this the last time you walked here.~
@22 = ~After winding through countless streets and small alleyways, you reach the point indicated in the map and stumble upon an unfamiliar alley.~
@23 = ~Amber's Kidnapping

Amber has been kidnapped by a group of slavers. One of them, a wizard, teleported away with Amber while the rest stayed to cover his escape. I doubt that this was an ordinary slave raid; I feel that there is a more specific purpose to this abduction. I'd better figure out where they took her before she disappears entirely.~
@24 = ~Amber's Kidnapping

It seems that the slavers, led by Captain Haegan were only a middlemen in Amber's kidnapping. Haegan mentioned someone named Ymmyrt, who had ordered the kidnapping and to whom they supposedly delivered Amber. Now I will just have to find this mysterious Ymmyrt character.~
@25 = ~Amber's Kidnapping

Judging from the words of Captain Haegan, the leader of the slavers, they were only middlemen in Amber's kidnapping. I have no idea where she is now, though. Maybe I can find some clues in their stockade.~
@26 = ~Amber's Kidnapping

I found a letter addressed from 'Y' to the captain of the slavers. It seems that Amber has already been transported to the custody of this 'Y'. I also found a strange map, that should probably lead me to this mystery person.~
@27 = ~You head back to the winding alleyways that led you to this strange house.~
@28 = ~After carefully backtracking your previous route, you manage to find your way to a familiar part of the city without too many detours.~
@29 = ~Retreat! Secure the entrance!~
@30 = ~Raise the alarm! Get reinforcements!~
@31 = ~Inside! Now!~
@32 = ~Aeeeeek!~
@33 = ~Aeeeeek! P-Please <SIRMAAM> don't hurt me!~
@34 = ~The wardstone you got from Lorraine seems to nullify the wards placed on the staircase and you are free to climb them.~
@35 = ~As you approach the stairs, you feel an uncomfortable buzzing in your head. If you wish, you can try to climb the stairs.~
@36 = ~You manage to fight the pain and struggle a few steps up the stairs, but before you reach the first landing you black out and fall down the stairs.~
@37 = ~You need to move closer to the stairs in order to examine them.~
@38 = ~There seems to be a rope made from bedsheets hanging from a broken second-story window. If you wish, you can try and climb up to the window.~
@39 = ~You try to climb up the rope, but when you are almost at the window, you slip and fall on the street.~
@40 = ~You deftly climb up the rope and help your comrades do the same.~
@41 = ~There seems to be something hanging from one of the windows overlooking the alley, but you cannot see anything more from this far away.~
@42 = ~I will crush you like the insignificant worm you are!~
@43 = ~You will all burn in hell for this!~
@44 = ~You are overcome with a profound sensation of relief and warmth as a tall column of light erupts from the machine.~
@45 = ~Rrraaaaaggghhh!!!~
@46 = ~Aaaiiieeehhhhh!!!~
@47 = ~Attack them, my pets!~
@48 = ~The window has been broken and a rope fashioned out of bedsheets runs through the hole. You can try to climb down the rope if you wish.~
@49 = ~The window seems to be broken, but you are too far away to examine it more closely.~
@50 = ~Amber's Kidnapping

Judging from the words of Captain Corin, the new leader of the remaining slavers, they were only middlemen in Amber's kidnapping. I have no idea where she is now, though. Maybe I can find some clues in their stockade.~
@51 = ~Amber's Kidnapping
 
I have successfully gotten rid of a woman who was undoubtedly one of the servants of the sorcerer Ymmyrt. Among her possessions was a wardstone that might help me get inside Ymmyrt's house.~
@52 = ~Lorraine's Son 

I have agreed to help Lorraine, a cleric and ranger of Mielikki, free the soul of her dead son from Ymmyrt's grip. The soul gem is supposed to be in Ymmyrt's bedchamber along with the key to his laboratory, where I hope to find the man himself. Lorraine warned me of an unusual demon guarding the chambers.~
@53 = ~Lorraine's Son

With Lorraine's aid I defeated the sorcerer Ymmyrt and am now free to pursuit my quest to find Amber. Lorraine herself seemed to find great comfort in the fact that her son is now finally at peace. Apparently though, she still has many battles to fight before her life is set back to its track.~
@54 = ~Amber's Kidnapping

I finally managed to catch up with Amber. Seems that I went through all that trouble for nothing, as she had already escaped. At least now I know for sure that she can take care of herself, but perhaps a 'thank you' would had been in order.~
@55 = ~The final battle with Bodhi

Bodhi appeared in an ambush shortly before I reached her haven, warning me that she was aware of my pursuit and stealing from me the one person that is dearest to my heart: Amber.  Before she vanished and unleashed more of her undead creations upon me, Bodhi warned me that if I continue I will lose even more than I thought possible.  I cannot give up on the Rhynn Lanthorn... but now the life and immortal soul of the one I love is at stake, as well!~
@56 = ~Could someone spare me a healing potion? I'm in a pretty bad shape here!~
@57 = ~Ack! I've been poisoned! Does someone have an antidote?~
@58 = ~Quickly, my love! Drink this!~
@59 = ~Quickly, someone give <PLAYER1> a potion or heal him! He's hurt bad!~
@60 = ~Quickly, someone heal <PLAYER1>! He's hurt and incapacitated!~
@61 = ~Quickly, Imoen! Drink this!~
@62 = ~Quickly, someone give <PLAYER2> a potion or heal him! He's hurt bad!~
@63 = ~Quickly, someone give Imoen a potion or heal her! She's hurt bad!~
@64 = ~Quickly, someone heal <PLAYER2>! He's hurt and incapacitated!~
@65 = ~Quickly, someone heal Imoen! She's hurt and incapacitated!~
@66 = ~Hang on <PLAYER1>!~
@67 = ~Hang on <PLAYER2>!~
@68 = ~Hang on Imoen!~
@69 = ~Hang on <PLAYER1>! I'm coming!~
@70 = ~Hang on <PLAYER2>! I'm coming!~
@71 = ~Hang on Imoen! I'm coming!~
@72 = ~DIE!!!~
@73 = ~What, where is the master's meal? Ooo... He will be so mad! I must cover for that stupid chef...~ 
@74 = ~Sure, I'll provide you with cover fire.~
@75 = ~Right, engage them up close and personal.~
@76 = ~Fine. I'll choose my own weapons.~
@77 = ~<CHARNAME>!~

@100 = ~Amber~ 
@101 = ~Who are you?~ [m#amb001]
@102 = ~By the Nine Hells! This would be my cue to exit.~ [m#amb002]
@103 = ~I guess that coming with you wasn't such a bad idea after all.~ [m#amb003]
@104 = ~I don't approve of this at all.~ [m#amb004]
@105 = ~You're such an ass, did you know that?~ [m#amb005]
@106 = ~That's it. I've had it - I will take no more of this stupidity.~ [m#amb006]
@107 = ~Me? A leader? You must be out of your mind.~ [m#amb007]
@108 = ~You don't suppose that we could stop for a while?~ [m#amb008]
@109 = ~I can't believe we're wasting our precious time like this.~ [m#amb009]
@110 = ~You had this coming, scum!~ [m#amb010]
@111 = ~I'll give you a sting you'll never forget!~ [m#amb011]
@112 = ~Only one of us will leave this place alive!~ [m#amb012]
@113 = ~Think you can catch me? You'd better think again!~ [m#amb013]
@114 = ~~ [m#amb014]
@115 = ~~ [m#amb015]
@116 = ~Aach! Where... *Is* that potion?~ [m#amb016]
@117 = ~I've spent nearly my whole life in cities... But in a way, I like it here.~ [m#amb017] 
@118 = ~You should watch your back here; I know what sort of folk inhabit places like this.~ [m#amb018]
@119 = ~Dark and damp, lovely. Whatever we're after here better be worth it.~ [m#amb019]
@120 = ~Hmphh... I'd prefer it to be night. So much cooler and quieter then.~ [m#amb020]
@121 = ~Ahh... Just look at the stars, they're so bright tonight.~ [m#amb021]
@122 = ~What do you want?~ [m#amb022]
@123 = ~I'm listening... for now.~ [m#amb023]
@124 = ~You need something again?~ [m#amb024]
@125 = ~Well, speak up then.~ [m#amb025]
@126 = ~Yes, I'm still here.~ [m#amb026]
@127 = ~Come on, give me a break.~ [m#amb027]
@128 = ~If you insist.~ [m#amb028]
@129 = ~Are you sure?~[m#amb029]
@130 = ~Whatever...~ [m#amb080]
@131 = ~All right, then.~ [m#amb030]
@132 = ~I suppose you're right.~ [m#amb031]
@133 = ~Must I?~ [m#amb032]
@134 = ~That's easy.~ [m#amb033]
@135 = ~Don't you have something better to do than pick on me?~ [m#amb034]
@136 = ~Stop poking me!~ [m#amb035]
@137 = ~Hah... Never saw that coming, did you?~ [m#amb036] 
@138 = ~Damn it!~  [m#amb037]
@139 = ~What? This can't be!~ [m#amb038]
@140 = ~I've already got more than enough. *You* carry that.~ [m#amb039]
@141 = ~Hmm... I don't think you'll be needing this.~ [m#amb040]
@142 = ~Ack! Where did that come from?~ [m#amb041]
@143 = ~This should teach them a lesson.~  [m#amb042]
@144 = ~When asked about her past AMBER claims that she has no memories of her childhood. She remembers nothing of her parents or of the place she grew up. Hesitantly she tells you that she lived years in the streets of Waterdeep until some unfortunate incident involving the local thieves' guild and city guard forced her to move to Luskan. There she only barely escaped an angry mob with the help of a young bard called Jill. As she speaks warmly of Jill and respectfully of the bard's brother Tristan, Amber's expression lightens somewhat. You can clearly understand that the two girls were close, but there is sadness in her eyes that tells you that her friend is long gone. As Amber's story goes on, you begin to wonder how old this exotic creature really is. She has visited lands so far away - from the frozen north to the heat of the southern deserts, travelled years with a circus group and yet her face betrays no signs of age. When you try to ask her about her age, she responds that it does not matter as the people around her never change, no matter how much time passes by. Prejudices die hard if ever.~

// m#banter.d

@1000 = ~What's it with the grin, Viconia?~
@1001 = ~Amber dear, you truly surprise me. One could *almost* have taken you for a real drow. In order to be truly convincing, however, you would have needed the sound of a whip to accentuate those moans coming from your bedchamber.~
@1002 = ~Or perhaps I should teach you how to perform the 'spider's kiss' on your favourite male.~
@1003 = ~The spider's kiss, eh? I don't think I even want to know what that means.~
@1004 = ~You can sweet talk all you want, Viconia, but I can see that you are up to no good, as usual. I cannot wait to get rid of this wretched form. It gives me quiet pleasure to know that you, on the other hand, will be stuck with it for the rest of your sorry life.~
@1005 = ~The pleasure is entirely mine, for I can't wait for you to cease demeaning the language of my people with your insolent babbling.~
@1006 = ~So, now we are on your territory, drow. You must be enjoying this like nothing else - I bet you were already feeling homesick.~
@1007 = ~But how could you not miss this place? Dark, damp and disgusting... There's no place like home, is there? And don't forget the endless possibilities for a gruesome death that lurk behind every rock and corner.~
@1008 = ~You think you're so clever, but I bet tha-~
@1009 = ~Hsssh! Both of you. This is not the place for that. Now be quiet or we'll all end up dead.~
@1010 = ~Could you guys shout just a little louder? I think there might still be something lurking at the other end of this cavern that couldn't quite hear what you were saying.~
@1011 = ~Well, your *presence* certainly doesn't help.~
@1012 = ~I couldn't care less what your people think about us, Viconia. Besides, I've seen much worse.~
@1013 = ~Is there something wrong, Imoen? You look pale.~
@1014 = ~This place gives me creeps. It seems that there is always something moving just out of the corner of your eye, if you get my meaning.~
@1015 = ~I know what you mean. I hope that <CHARNAME> will lead us away from here as soon as possible.~
@1016 = ~(Amber sighs heavyly.)~
@1017 = ~Do not worry my angel - I will keep a sharp eye for anything that might seek to harm you in this fell pit of darkness.~
@1018 = ~Hey! Keep that arm off my shoulders! I am not some silly child who is afraid of the dark.~
@1019 = ~Well, this must be one of the few places where I'm glad to have you around me, old tinhead.~
@1020 = ~As little as I appreciate you calling me a tinhead, I suppose it was as much of a compliment as I can ever expect from you, Amber.~
@1021 = ~I'm afraid your woodsman's skills are of little use here, Cernd.~
@1022 = ~Despair not, little sister. Darkness may weigh heavily on our shoulders, but let it not darken our hearts.~
@1023 = ~Why such a long face, Jan?~
@1024 = ~I certainly did not expect to end my days in such company, Amber.~
@1025 = ~End your days? You are certain that we will perish, then?~
@1026 = ~Oh? Quite certain, actually. And I am almost certain that it will be the most vile, gruesome, agonising death you can imagine, too.~
@1027 = ~You are joking again, Jan... Right?~
@1028 = ~No, no, no. I am dead serious. I always am.~
@1029 = ~Not feeling so brave now, Anomen?~
@1030 = ~Bah! Only a child would be afraid of the dark. This is definitely not the first dungeon I have been in, nor shall it be the last.~
@1031 = ~Only a true fool would not be concerned about venturing into the Underdark. It's not just some common orc hole, you know.~
@1032 = ~I can smell your fear, tiefling. Fall back and let the more capable lead on.~
@1033 = ~As long as I'm not downwind from you, it's fine by me.~
@1034 = ~Hey! Watch it, Aerie! You shouldn't be bumping into me like that, at least not when I'm carrying a sharp blade.~
@1035 = ~I-I think I saw something moving in the shadows!~
@1036 = ~It was probably just a flicker of torchlight.~
@1037 = ~At least I hope so.~
@1038 = ~I-I don't know how much longer I can t-take this. I know I should be brave, but i-it's just so creepy here and... And I'm scared!~
@1039 = ~Here, take hold of my hand if it makes you feel better, but do keep a spell ready - there *will* be trouble in a place like this.~
@1040 = ~So... Um... Edwin. Would you not think that now would be a good time to cast an illuminating spell?~
@1041 = ~Hmph. (And now the fiendling wishes me to light a candle to ward away her fear of the dark. Edwin, do this. Edwin, do that. Nauseating.) Such minor tasks are far beneath my talents. Now scurry along, little beast, and leave me be.~
@1042 = ~Your fearlessness must truly be boundless, Minsc. You don't seem the slightest bit worried.~
@1043 = ~Fear you not! Minsc and Boo will see that no harm comes to Amber or our other little friends!~
@1044 = ~Yes! Minsc and Boo will surely smite evil. And smite it hard, too! RRRRAAAAAAGH!~
@1045 = ~Uh... Perhaps you would still want to keep it down a bit, Minsc. We'd rather smite all the evils that lurks here one by one, not all at once, don't you think?~
@1046 = ~Oh? One by one? Minsc does not quite see the fun in that, but if pretty Amber insists.~
@1047 = ~I think we just became the unfortunate that you so avidly seek to help, Nalia.~
@1048 = ~You just might be right, Amber. This must be the most wicked pit of darkness there ever was.~
@1049 = ~What are you staring at, dwarf?~
@1050 = ~Just enjoyin' the sight of yer smartass mouth being shut for once. Not feelin' so chatty now, huh kitten? Feel ya the darkness just a little bit too 'eavy for yer tastes?~
@1051 = ~You are *really* enjoying all of this, aren't you?~
@1052 = ~So, Amber, what is it that you see with those weird eyes of yours?~
@1053 = ~Well, what do you think, girl? Right now the only thing I see is frogs jumping out of your mouth.~
@1054 = ~Hey, no need to get so agitated. I didn't mean it in a bad way.~
@1055 = ~Well, you sure managed to make it sound like you did.~
@1056 = ~A bit touchy are we? But anyway, what I really meant to ask was whether you could perhaps see real well in the dark or something - like cats do. Just because, you know, you do move really cat-like and it would sort of fit in the picture. And that was meant as a compliment, by the way.~
@1057 = ~Yes, you could say that I can find my way around even after sunset. I'm sorry that I snapped at you... I'm just not used to people asking such questions out of sincere curiosity.~
@1058 = ~No harm done, don't you worry. And the next time some moron fires a stupid question at you - like what's with the odd hair colour - just answer them with an equally stupid answer.~
@1059 = ~So, what *is* it with that hair of yours, anyway?~
@1060 = ~Amber, you said that you were in a circus once - Amazing Fabrizio's something? Somewhere up north? Why did you leave? Were they treating you badly?~
@1061 = ~No, I actually liked it there - Amazing Fabrizio's Circus of Miraculous Oddities was the closest thing to a real home I've ever had. When I was flying trough the air from trapeze to trapeze or walking the tightrope, I felt so free and...~
@1062 = ~It-it has nothing to do with flying - being a trapeze artist. You couldn't... There is no way that you could have any idea of the feeling of freedom flying can give you.~
@1063 = ~Aerie, it is not my fault that you lost your wings. It was not even the same circus.~
@1064 = ~Hey, Aerie, perhaps you should try it sometime if you haven't yet. It's not like you're afraid of heights or anything. Anyway, Amber, you were telling me about flying through the air.~
@1065 = ~...I just cannot describe it in a way that would do it any justice. ~
@1066 = ~The owner and ringmaster of the circus, Old Fabrizio, was a kind man... but he... he died. His nephew, Bruno, was very different from his uncle; he thought that being the owner granted him all sorts of liberties. For some reason he fancied me and when I turned him down, he kicked me out.~
@1067 = ~That's awful. I hope you broke his nose!~
@1068 = ~No, but I gave him a sting he would never forget. Ever. My trapeze partner, Sasha... he offered to come with me but I told him not to.~
@1069 = ~A few years later I heard that he had fallen. His new partner's grip had slipped, and we never used a net... I miss him, but I don't think that he would've been happy away from the circus, so maybe it was for the best. He knew the dangers, after all, and he died doing what he loved most.~
@1070 = ~But could you not have taken him to another circus with you?~
@1071 = ~No, that part of my life was over. And besides, circuses are like families - or at least the ones worth belonging to are. You can't just march into one.~
@1072 = ~Imoen?~
@1073 = ~Heya! What's up Amber?~
@1074 = ~What was it that happened in Irenicus' dungeon? Or in Spellhold? You never talk about it, but every time someone mentions Irenicus or Bodhi you get that look in your eyes...~
@1075 = ~Well, I just hate being locked up... I bet you can understand that, Amber. I don't really feel like digging into those memories right now. It's rather dull and uninteresting anyway. Let's figure out something else to do, instead.~
@1076 = ~As you wish.~
@1077 = ~Hey! I thought I just saw one of your tattoos move!~
@1078 = ~(Amber smiles.) They're not really tattoos, Imoen, but yes, they do tend to move from time to time. They are a 'gift' from my ancestors, no doubt.~
@1079 = ~Wow! I wish I was a fortune teller or a mystic so that I could predict some wonderful future for you by exploring your skin!~
@1080 = ~You wish to explore my skin? My, my, what a tempting thought...~
@1081 = ~You *do* know that you're horribly wicked, don't you, Amber?~
@1082 = ~I know, my friend, I know. And I'm enjoying every moment of it.~
@1083 = ~Well, if you're not careful enough I just might do it!~
@1084 = ~Hey, Amber what do you want to be when you grow up?~
@1085 = ~Are you subtly insinuating that there is something lacking in my stature?~
@1086 = ~Well, let's just say that there is no hope for you being known as the tallest bearded woman in Amn, if you're that skimpy.~
@1087 = ~Imoen, aren't you forgetting something?~
@1088 = ~Me? Forgetting? Be gone with such false accusations!~
@1089 = ~I think you are overlooking the fact that being known as the tallest bearded woman in Amn would require me to actually be able to grow a beard.~
@1090 = ~Well, then it's about time for you to start considering other career options. You have already been an adventurer in the world's second coolest adventuring party, a circus star, a potential witch - at least a few times - and now you're in the greatest and coolest adventuring party ever. What's next?~
@1091 = ~Hah-ha! It sure does seem that there is no way to go but down. But...~
@1092 = ~After this ends... I-I...~
@1093 = ~W-What? Did I say something funny - or something not funny? Why are you all pale and quiet suddenly?~
@1094 = ~Hush, Imoen - it's nothing. Come on, we should get going.~
@1095 = ~So, you're now together with my brother, eh?~
@1096 = ~If you mean that we're sleeping together, then yeah, we're together.~
@1097 = ~You're saying that it's just sex and nothing more?~
@1098 = ~No, Imoen for my part it isn't. I... I love <CHARNAME>, but I'm not certain how he feels.~
@1099 = ~I'm sure he loves you too. He can just be such a jackass sometimes. He might not realise that he should actually get around to saying it. Come on girl, I'll give you a hug to feel better.~
@1100 = ~Wow, you're hot!~
@1101 = ~(Amber giggles mischievously.) So, you think I'm hot? Well, you're not so bad yourself, either.~
@1102 = ~Well thank you! But what *is* the matter with you? You're not sick, are you?~
@1103 = ~No, I'm perfectly fine. It's just the little demon inside me that causes me to run slightly hotter than you 'normal' people.~
@1104 = ~Well, you can hardly consider anyone in this party 'normal', if you get my meaning.~
@1105 = ~But we should probably get our pretty asses going - I think <CHARNAME> is getting impatient. He's tapping his foot again.~
@1106 = ~Ah, my fiery angel. This sparrow apologises that he has not yet introduced himself properly. My name is Haer'Dalis - bard, blade and planewalker - and it is a sweet pleasure to meet you.~
@1107 = ~My name is Amber, no silly epithets, and I am not sure if I am equally pleased... I am hardly an angel, and you should know better than to mock me so.~
@1108 = ~I sense anger in you, my hummingbird. May this humble bard inquire the reason for your sudden irascibility?~
@1109 = ~No, you may not.~
@1110 = ~Our kin rarely cross paths while walking among primes - certainly there must be some greater meaning in ours thus entwining, my sweet hummingbird. The very moment this bard laid eyes upon you, he knew that you would have a major role in the play that makes up the life of this sparrow.~
@1111 = ~Not a big believer in coincidence, are you? Tell me, Haer'Dalis, is there a point to all this chatter?~
@1112 = ~Ah, I see that you are one who wishes to jump straight to the final page of the book, my impatient angel. That is not the way stories are told. Nay, the second act can never come afore the first.~
@1113 = ~You look disheartened, my dashing hummingbird. Perhaps a poem by this sparrow would lighten your spirits?~
@1114 = ~"Now therefore, while the youthful hue
Sits on thy skin like morning dew,
And while thy willing soul transpires
At every pore with instant fires,
Now let us sport us while we may,
And now, like amorous birds of prey,
Rather at once our time devour
Than languish in his slow-chapped power."~
@1115 = ~"Let us roll all our strength and all
Our sweetness up into one ball,
And tear our pleasures with rough strife
Thorough the iron gates of life:
Thus, though we cannot make our sun
Stand still, yet we will make him run."~
@1116 = ~(Amber sighs, rubbing at her temples as if to ward off this sudden flow of gallantry.)~
@1117 = ~It saddens this poet's heart that you are not talking to me, my lovely hummingbird. Would you not bare your soul to me and tell me what ails you?~
@1118 = ~Look, Haer'Dalis or sparrow or whatever... First of all, I do have a proper name and I would like you to use it instead of those silly pet names you are making up.~
@1119 = ~Secondly, your words and poems are pretty, but that is all they are: pretty words without meaning. Were you to put your heart and soul into them, I might listen, but as long as they remain as empty as they are, I will not.~
@1120 = ~Maybe your rhymings can impress young Aerie here, but they hardly manage to dazzle me. Besides, the lack of any moral backbone you display by coming here and sweet talking to me, while a moment ago it was all about your mourning dove, just makes me sick.~
@1121 = ~Please leave me alone, I do not care for your idle words.~
@1122 = ~My fiery hummingbird - I will do as you ask and leave you for now. But know that you are wrong: the heart and soul of this poet is ever embedded within his words. Never are my words empty or bereft of meaning.~
@1123 = ~Haer'Dalis, I wish to apologise for my earlier behaviour - I might have been a little too harsh on you. You must understand, however, that I do not want to hear any mush or sweet talk from you.~
@1124 = ~No poems, pet names or any nonsense like that, and if you manage to keep your hands to yourself, I might even consider some day calling you my friend in addition to this apology.~
@1125 = ~Am I making myself clear here?~
@1126 = ~Ah... Coming from your tender lips, that apology is most welcome, my...eh...Amber. Nothing would make this sparrow more joyous than having the privilege to call you a friend, my hummingbird.~
@1127 = ~I guess that you are just incurable. I will let it slide this time, but don't push it.~
@1128 = ~I have been watching you during the time we have spent in this group together, and I must admit that you are nimbler and more cunning than I gave you credit for, little redhead.~
@1129 = ~But there is one thing I cannot help wondering. Why are you always so frightened, little vixen?~
@1130 = ~I have no idea what you're talking about, drow.~
@1131 = ~Yes you do. You pretend to be so bold and fearless, but I can see right through your pretty little act.~
@1132 = ~How come you live on the surface, Viconia? I thought your kin preferred the darkness of their underground holes. I have certainly heard of renegade drow who have forsaken the evil ways of their culture, but I can't really see you in that category.~
@1133 = ~Don't pretend to be wiser than you are, fool. Dos orn lor saph biu mal'ai.~
@1134 = ~I think you just proved my point.~
@1135 = ~I don't have to prove anything to you, maggot. Now, leave me alone.~
@1136 = ~Well, you obviously don't feel the need to answer my question, do you? Or are you just trying to avoid it?~
@1137 = ~I have little patience for your prattle, lotha nuij. But you should know this: many of those who flee the caverns below are but hapless fools and weaklings - but it would be a dangerous mistake for you to take me for one of them.~
@1138 = ~So, lotha nuij, I understand that you have spent a great deal of time with the wayward auflaqui that you surfacers know as gypsies?~
@1139 = ~I will not hear you insult those who were once like a family to me.~
@1140 = ~You can turn your back to me, but it does not change the fact that you are weak, fiendling. And foolish, when you waste your affection on those who live at the mercy of peasants - their whole existence contingent on the whims of the idiotic crowd, whom they seek to amuse with their petty tricks. Even beggars have more dignity than those clowns.~
@1141 = ~Viconia, would you please stop doing that?~
@1142 = ~Doing what, surfacer?~
@1143 = ~Living up to every preconception anyone has ever had about your kin. Somehow you manage to fulfil every stereotype of the drow there is. I would like to believe that one cannot judge anyone by their race or profession, but you're shaking that belief up really good. You're probably the most disagreeable person I've ever met, and that's saying a lot.~
@1144 = ~You're a witless fool, lotha nuij. If you think I'm disagreeable, you'd better look into the mirror. Oh, but I forget; that must be terribly difficult for you since they keep breaking every time you try to do that.~
@1145 = ~Dos zhal'la shar dosst ehmtu chaon.~
@1146 = ~Ah, my fellow rogue... I think that I could teach you a trick or two of our common trade.~
@1147 = ~And *I* think that you think too much of yourself, Yoshimo.~
@1148 = ~Perhaps, but if I myself don't trust my abilities, who does?~
@1149 = ~Who cares?~
@1150 = ~Now, no need to be rude, young one. I graciously offered my skills for your benefit, but if you are not interested, I shall withdraw my proposal.~
@1151 = ~I suppose it's my loss then. What a shame.~
@1152 = ~A-Amber, can I ask you something?~
@1153 = ~What is it, Aerie?~
@1154 = ~Have you ever been captured into a circus. I-I mean, looking as you do... One could see someone wanting to l-lock you up for display.~
@1155 = ~Well, I have worked in a circus, but I joined it of my own free will and was never displayed in a cage like a beast. I worked as a trapeze artist in Amazing Fabrizio's Circus of Miraculous Oddities years and years ago.~
@1156 = ~Th-that sounds like fun, I guess. I would have liked to be a real performer instead of a... a caged b-beast, as you said.~
@1157 = ~Well, if you would learn to stand up for yourself instead of whining all the time... Maybe you could actually become something.~
@1158 = ~H-how can you be so cruel? I have... I have done nothing to hurt you and yet...~
@1159 = ~I do not mean to be cruel, Aerie. I'm just telling you what I think is true - it's about time you learned to face the truth. Life is a tough game: you cannot count on someone else standing up for you. You have to be prepared to do it yourself.~
@1160 = ~I-I will try, but I'm not so sure if I want to see the world like you do. I don't believe life is as harsh as you would want me to think.~
@1161 = ~I honestly cannot fathom why <CHARNAME> tolerates your presence. You draw unnecessary amounts of negative attention to this party.~
@1162 = ~'Negative attention?' If that is the opposite of what people like you draw to themselves, thank the gods for negative attention.~
@1163 = ~Hold your tongue. Someone of my prestige should not suffer the insults of the witless. Once I rise in ranks of the Order, I shall make it my mission to rid Amn of the taint of your twisted kin.~
@1164 = ~You will indeed make a fine addition to the pompous brats of the Order. Judge, execute and ask questions later, if ever, eh? You are a prime example of a single-minded fool, Anomen.~
@1165 = ~If anybody is a fool here, it is you. A lying fool you are, tiefling. There is nothing that you can say to make me think otherwise. Keep your treacherous tongue in check, or suffer the consequences.~
@1166 = ~I have nothing to say to you anyway.~
@1167 = ~You really are a strange man, Cernd.~
@1168 = ~I for my part find it curious that you should think so, as I am the most ordinary of men. Although, if you wish me to elaborate on my ordinary nature, you will have to provide me with information on your reasons to believe me so strange.~
@1169 = ~Well, you can turn yourself into a beast at will, you have lost your wife and abandoned your child for what you think is a greater cause, and you are always calm and emotionless even if there is a battle raging around you. How do you manage that? Where is that rush of blood and passion people usually feel when faced with such things?~
@1170 = ~When one is at peace with oneself, one is at peace with one's surroundings. But you are mistaken if you think me emotionless. I *do* care what happens around me, and I feel that I can play my own part in maintaining the Balance.  That is what gives me my peace of mind.~
@1171 = ~I see. But what if the surroundings are not at peace with you?~
@1172 = ~When you cease to see yourself as separate from your surroundings, that question will be of no relevance.~
@1173 = ~You are a pretty creature, yes? (That's right, flatter her, that works with women.) How is it that you have such radiant hair?~
@1174 = ~What is it that you want, wizard?~
@1175 = ~Oh, it's a small thing really... (Yes, make it sound insignificant, the foolish girl won't be able to refuse.) Hardly worth even mentioning.~
@1176 = ~Then don't mention it.~
@1177 = ~Amber, I have noticed that you are no stranger to the art of riddles. Perhaps this bard could persuade you to enter into a competition of sorts?~
@1178 = ~No, I don't think so. I'm not foolish enough to be lured into a riddling competition with a word twister like you. Been there, done that, and ended up losing every time.~
@1179 = ~Yet you subject yourself to defeat over and over again with our raven here; after all, he is a bard of sorts as well. Why so cruelly exclude this poet from a friendly game of wits?~
@1180 = ~Well, with him I do not mind fulfilling his wish, should I lose the game.~
@1181 = ~Yet you subject yourself to defeat over and over again with our raven here. Even though he is no fool, he is no wordsmith either. Thus the game with him must be a rather boring experience, don't you agree, my hummingbird? Why so cruelly exclude this poet from a friendly game of wits? Come now, let us set our wits to work against each other. ~
@1182 = ~No, I don't think so.~
@1183 = ~Yet you subject yourself to defeat over and over again with our mockingbird here; after all, he is a bard of sorts as well. Why so cruelly exclude this poet from a friendly game of wits?~
@1184 = ~Yet you subject yourself to defeat over and over again with our mockingbird here. Even though <PLAYER2> is no fool, he is no wordsmith either. Thus the game with him must be a rather boring experience, don't you agree, my hummingbird? Why so cruelly exclude this poet from a friendly game of wits? Come now, let us set our wits to work against each other. ~
@1185 = ~Yet you subject yourself to defeat over and over again with our owl here. Even though <PLAYER2> is no fool, he is no wordsmith either. Thus the game with him must be a rather boring experience, don't you agree, my hummingbird? Why so cruelly exclude this poet from a friendly game of wits? Come now, let us set our wits to work against each other. ~
@1186 = ~Yet you subject yourself to defeat over and over again with our hawk here. Even though <PLAYER2> is no fool, he is no wordsmith either. Thus the game with him must be a rather boring experience, don't you agree, my hummingbird? Why so cruelly exclude this poet from a friendly game of wits? Come now, let us set our wits to work against each other. ~
@1187 = ~Yet you subject yourself to defeat over and over again with our ibis here. Even though <PLAYER2> is no fool, he is no wordsmith either. Thus the game with him must be a rather boring experience, don't you agree, my hummingbird? Why so cruelly exclude this poet from a friendly game of wits? Come now, let us set our wits to work against each other. ~
@1188 = ~Yet you subject yourself to defeat over and over again with our hound here. Even though <PLAYER2> is no fool, he is no wordsmith either. Thus the game with him must be a rather boring experience, don't you agree, my hummingbird? Why so cruelly exclude this poet from a friendly game of wits? Come now, let us set our wits to work against each other. ~
@1189 = ~But who is it then, my hummingbird, that taught you not to engage in a game of wits with one of my calling? This bard would be honoured to hear of another master of words.~
@1190 = ~Well, you are a tad late for that.~
@1191 = ~Another songbird penned to the dead book? What a shame, but that is the way of the planes, after all: we are born, live to unfold our potential entropy, and finally become one with it as the sweet oblivion claims us.~
@1192 = ~But tell me, my angel, was not this bard of yours dear to you? A first love perhaps?  The first pilgrim to pass those sweet lips of yours?~
@1193 = ~A dear friend, yes, but the rest is merely *your* fantasy, Haer'Dalis. Not all dear friends can be counted as lovers, but then again, the whole concept of 'just friends' must to be rather alien to you.~
@1194 = ~Ah, but can you blame this merry sparrow for his desires when surrounded with friends such as yourself?~
@1195 = ~Can I ask you something, Jaheira?~
@1196 = ~Yes?~
@1197 = ~I was just wondering, is there anything in this world you wouldn't have an opinion or advice on? You always seem to know better, regardless of whether something is your business or not.~
@1198 = ~And that irritates you? The way I see it, we have precious little time to waste on nonsense, and there are times when I must offer my guidance to those that would otherwise be in the dark.~
@1199 = ~Where I come from, it is considered only wise to share whatever wisdom could help solve a problem.~
@1200 = ~Well, where I come from, it is mostly considered impolite to meddle with the affairs of others.~
@1201 = ~We obviously come from very different places, then.~
@1202 = ~Now Amber, I've been noticing that you've got the same problem as my second cousin's wife Nana. I may have spoken of her before. She was...~
@1203 = ~And what problem would that be, Jan?~
@1204 = ~With her eyes. You see, she had the most hideous, tiny, bloodshot pig eyes that you can imagine.~
@1205 = ~I'm not sure I wish to know where this is going...~
@1206 = ~Anyway, she had these glasses made to her to hide her eyes from people... I was thinking of fixing you up with a similar pair - maybe with few nifty accessories to spice them up a bit, like...~
@1207 = ~Thank you, but I think I'll pass.~
@1208 = ~Amber, I have been watching you and I must say that your manners could use some improvement. When you talk to someone, especially someone older than yourself, you should be more polite instead of sarcastic and rude.~
@1209 = ~Don't talk to me like I was a child, knight. I have seen more winters than you. And besides, what would you know about raising children anyway? From what I have heard, you were not exactly available when your own kids needed your guidance.~
@1210 = ~That is exactly what I am talking about, Amber. I agree that attack is often the best defence, but I also think that you should take more control over your defensive instincts, lest your defence be perceived as offence.~
@1211 = ~And as to your accusations, do not think that I am not aware of my own shortcomings - being a member of the Order does not make me perfect, but you must understand that my duties to the Order are supreme and sometimes require sacrifices on other walks of life.~
@1212 = ~Sir Keldorn is right, Amber. You do not strike me as an evil person, and thus I do not believe it is your intention to deliberately hurt other people's feelings.~
@1213 = ~Why, did yer mother hump a tomcat or something? That be the freakiest pair o' eyes I ever laid mine on.~
@1214 = ~Get lost, dwarf. I have very little patience for the likes of you.~
@1215 = ~Ye be sure to watch that tongue of yers, kitten. I hear a demon tongue'll fetch a decent price on the market these days. Yers should be worth at least some of that.~
@1216 = ~You really are full of surprises, my friend. Although I should not be surprised by you showing such strength of character - after all, it seems to be second nature to you.~
@1217 = ~I thank you for your praise, but at the same time I cannot help but wonder whether it is warranted. I would not want to be glorified without merit.~
@1218 = ~I just couldn't help noticing how calmly you handled that twat of a would-be knight. I know that I certainly would have lost my temper with his insolence.~
@1219 = ~Anomen is still quite young and desperately in need of guidance. Patience and tolerance are the virtues he most desperately needs to learn.~
@1220 = ~And the only way to teach him is by example, right? Your efforts may well prove worthwhile, but I wouldn't bet my money on your success, Mazzy.~
@1221 = ~Gambling is not something that a knight should indulge in anyway, so I would advise you not to put your money on Anomen failing, either.~
@1222 = ~Well, we will just have to see about that, won't we.~
@1223 = ~Oh! Minsc did not see you there! Amber should not sneak around like that, or she will be severely squashed by accident.~
@1224 = ~I'll be careful, fear not. But I wanted to ask you something, if you don't mind, Minsc.~
@1225 = ~Minsc will be happy to answer.~
@1226 = ~I have heard you mention someone named Dynaheir. Who's that?~
@1227 = ~Dynaheir was Minsc's witch, part of his dejemma. Thinking of her makes Boo sad. We failed her. Now I will never be a man in the eyes of my tribe's elders. Dynaheir was wise and beautiful, but now she is gone.~
@1228 = ~I am truly sad to hear that your friend has passed away, but why do you care so much what others think? You're powerful and brave in battle, and I'm sure you did everything you could for her. You are no less of a man just because she didn't make it.~
@1229 = ~You are very kind to say so, but Boo thinks that you do not quite understand the true meaning of dejemma.~
@1230 = ~I understand that you have travelled quite a bit, Amber. Tell me: are cities the same all over Faerûn?~
@1231 = ~You mean whether there are opulent mansions with noblemen idly wandering around in their private gardens next to filthy slums, where disease spreads like a wildfire?~
@1232 = ~Yes, that's exactly what I meant. Though I doubt that I could have described it as vividly.~
@1233 = ~I suppose it's because I have seen both. But to answer your question: yes, it does not really matter where your travel. Large cities are much the same when it comes to the distribution of wealth.~
@1234 = ~You sure don't talk much, do you?~
@1235 = ~I do not wish to waste my breath on idle chatter, Amber.~
@1236 = ~Oh, and I thought you were one of those people who believes in not saying anything at all if they have nothing nice to say.~
@1237 = ~What do you mean to imply by that? That I do not have anything nice to say to people?~
@1238 = ~Well, do you?~
@1239 = ~So, little vixen...~
@1240 = ~I understand that you are rather intimate with <CHARNAME> nowadays, are you not?~
@1241 = ~I understand that you are rather intimate with <PLAYER2> nowadays, are you not?~
@1242 = ~Intimate? What an odd choice of words for you. I would have expected something much more banal from you, drow.~
@1243 = ~Watch your tongue, fiendling. It's getting much too sharp for your own good. I merely wished to inform you that attaching yourself to the jaluk will make you weak.~
@1244 = ~So, Yoshimo, you've certainly come a long way from home. What brings you to the Sword Coast?~
@1245 = ~I could say the same of you, red one. I don't know whether you have fallen from the heavens or risen from the hells, but your home is not here.~
@1246 = ~Always wanted to be a poet, have you? I was trying to make amends for my earlier behaviour, but if you have nothing more constructive to say, you might as well forget it.~
@1247 = ~Forgive me, but I do not see the reason for your annoyance.~
@1248 = ~Like I said: forget it.~
@1249 = ~Does... does it ever bother you, Amber? Th-That people stare at you?~
@1250 = ~It's not the staring that bothers me; I would most likely stare at someone like me, should I be one of them. What gets to me is that they are always so ready to pass judgement on me without knowing the first thing about me.~
@1251 = ~Okay, knightling. It's pretty obvious that you don't like me, and to tell you the truth, I don't care much about you either.  So you can stop giving me those self-righteous, disapproving glares. Somebody might think that you're actually checking out my figure and that is something you wouldn't want, would you?~
@1252 = ~Hah, I shall not waste my breath on your insults, tiefling.~
@1253 = ~Afraid that you might lose to this witless, lying fool? Or have you simply run out of insults?~
@1254 = ~You won't be able provoke me this time.~
@1255 = ~That's the spirit, Anomen. Do not demean yourself by trading insults with this... with her. She is only trying to irritate you. If you just maintain your dignity and refuse to play her games, she cannot but stop harassing you.~
@1256 = ~Cernd, you always preach how nature can teach us great things and I have been thinking about that. But whenever I try to concentrate in this place and observe my surroundings, my senses are overwhelmed by all the noises and sights and smells. I don't even know where to begin.~
@1257 = ~I understand your difficulty, Amber. I, too, felt overwhelmed when I first set foot in the crowded streets of Athkatla. I soon learned that focusing on small things at first made it easier to deal with larger wholes later on. Do not try to observe everything at once, Amber.~
@1258 = ~Close your eyes and just listen to the rustle of leaves and birds singing. Soon enough you will be able to concentrate on just the birds and can start to discern the individual voices that together compose the sweet concerto for which we are privileged to be the audience.~
@1259 = ~Hmmm... That is probably not a bad suggestion at all.~
@1260 = ~NO, Edwin! I told you! You can't have a lock of my hair! Stop touching me or you'll come to regret your arrogance severely!~
@1261 = ~No, no! You need not to fear me! (Careful here. Your powerful presence obviously frightens the creature.) I just want to talk with you. (Yes, girls like to talk.)~
@1262 = ~Well, I don't want to talk to you, wizard! Now get lost!~
@1263 = ~Ah, my hummingbird of love.~
@1264 = ~You have made our raven the most blessed man on this earth. But this sparrow must wonder; who shall be the king of the planes?~
@1265 = ~You have made our hawk the most blessed man on this earth. But this sparrow must wonder; who shall be the king of the planes?~
@1266 = ~You have made our mockingbird the most blessed man on this earth. But this sparrow must wonder; who shall be the king of the planes?~
@1267 = ~You have made our owl the most blessed man on this earth. But this sparrow must wonder; who shall be the king of the planes?~
@1268 = ~You have made our ibis the most blessed man on this earth. But this sparrow must wonder; who shall be the king of the planes?~
@1269 = ~You have made our hound the most blessed man on this earth. But this sparrow must wonder; who shall be the king of the planes?~
@1270 = ~If you're suggesting that you, I or any of our blood could bestow a blessing on anything, you are even more deranged than I thought.~
@1271 = ~Don't you try slipping away from my question, my hummingbird.~
@1272 = ~The only thing slipping here is your mind, bard.~
@1273 = ~Now that, my angel, would be unfortunate indeed... were it to be true. But let this bard makes his rhymes a little clearer: the raven rules your heart this day, that much is plain to see, but foresee you not the dusk of it already?~
@1274 = ~Now that, my angel, would be unfortunate indeed... were it to be true. But let this bard makes his rhymes a little clearer: the hawk rules your heart this day, that much is plain to see, but foresee you not the dusk of it already?~
@1275 = ~Now that, my angel, would be unfortunate indeed... were it to be true. But let this bard makes his rhymes a little clearer: the mockingbird rules your heart this day, that much is plain to see, but foresee you not the dusk of it already?~
@1276 = ~Now that, my angel, would be unfortunate indeed... were it to be true. But let this bard makes his rhymes a little clearer: the owl rules your heart this day, that much is plain to see, but foresee you not the dusk of it already?~
@1277 = ~Now that, my angel, would be unfortunate indeed... were it to be true. But let this bard makes his rhymes a little clearer: the ibis rules your heart this day, that much is plain to see, but foresee you not the dusk of it already?~
@1278 = ~Now that, my angel, would be unfortunate indeed... were it to be true. But let this bard makes his rhymes a little clearer: the hound rules your heart this day, that much is plain to see, but foresee you not the dusk of it already?~
@1279 = ~The king of chaos asks me to foresee the future? Since when have you been interested in the longevity of anything?~
@1280 = ~So I am a king to you, after all? Very well, I shall consider my question answered.~
@1281 = ~W-what? To the hells with you and your word-games, bard!~
@1282 = ~Why it is so difficult for you to admit that you miss your husband, Jaheira?~
@1283 = ~What did you say to me about meddling with the affairs of others? I see that it is not one of your greatest virtues, either.~
@1284 = ~I just wanted to learn more about you - and perhaps figure out why you're always so high-strung.~
@1285 = ~It was curiosity that killed the cat, you know.~
@1286 = ~Is that a threat?~
@1287 = ~No, it's your cue to shut up.~
@1288 = ~Hey, Jan! I found this lying on the ground. Looks like something that fell off your backpack.~
@1289 = ~Oh thank you, dearie - I would indeed have missed this. Misplacing things runs in the Jansen family - sort of  a family trait, you see. Though only on the male side of it, mind you. Never figured out why that is.~
@1290 = ~That is one curious looking device, by the way. What is it?~
@1291 = ~It is just a little something I whipped up in my spare time. I call it the Gnomish De-Hirsuter. Quite a handy little device, I might add.~
@1292 = ~Alright... But what does it *do*? What is the purpose of that thing?~
@1293 = ~Well, it is excels in facilitating the elimination of excessive or otherwise intrusive fuzziness of the corpus.~
@1294 = ~'Fuzziness'?~
@1295 = ~Um, you know, body hair.~
@1296 = ~I see... Well, I suppose it's one of those things you never knew you needed.~
@1297 = ~Look, Keldorn, a bunny!~
@1298 = ~Erm... Yes indeed, it seems to be a white rabbit. What about it?~
@1299 = ~Come on! Doesn't that white, fuzzy cuteness make your old heart flutter at least the tiniest bit inside that hard, cold armour?~
@1300 = ~Mmm-huh. Ye could sure use some paddin' on that skinny arse o' yer, kitten.~
@1301 = ~Get your filthy hands off me!~
@1302 = ~I cannot help but wonder how you manage to keep up such a brave face, Mazzy. The Shade Lord wiped out your entire party and turned someone you love into an undead shade. ~
@1303 = ~Yet you manage to maintain a composed posture. I like to think of myself as someone who does not worry about water under the bridge, but your stoicism still manages to amaze me.~
@1304 = ~Well, I know that no amount of grief will ever bring my dear companions back. Of course that does not prevent me from wishing that things would have turned out differently or from missing Patrick and my other friends.~
@1305 = ~However, we all knew what could happen and everyone took the risk voluntarily. I understand that you are not new to adventuring yourself, and thus certainly not a stranger to the grief of losing a comrade in arms.~
@1306 = ~You are right, Mazzy. More so than you even know.~
@1307 = ~Minsc has a question for Amber.~
@1308 = ~Go ahead, Minsc. What is it that bothers you?~
@1309 = ~Minsc has noticed that Amber can kick evil's backside mighty and good. But Boo wonders how can that be. Amber is much bigger and clumsier than Boo, but compared to Minsc, Amber is really tiny, and not very strong, either.~
@1310 = ~Boo can bite evil in hard to reach places, and Minsc can smite evil with his strong arms, but what does Amber do? Amber has nice smooth hands like Dynaheir, but she does not cast powerful magic.~
@1311 = ~This must really bother you, Minsc... Well, to put it simply, I have to wait for the right moment to strike at evil. Because I'm not strong like Minsc or small and fast like Boo, I cannot just charge blindly to the battle.~
@1312 = ~Oooo... So it is patience and cunning that Amber has. Well, Boo thinks that is all nice and cute, but Minsc prefers to kick evil straight away. No waiting for Minsc.~
@1313 = ~And evil would do well not to mess with Minsc and Boo. But come, Minsc, we must get going or <CHARNAME> will kick our backsides for falling behind.~
@1314 = ~What did you family say when you decided to start studying magic, Nalia?~
@1315 = ~They were somewhat surprised, perhaps even taken aback. Aunt Delia could not fathom how the future wife of a nobleman would benefit from studying 'cantrips', as she put it.~
@1316 = ~I am glad that you didn't end up becoming one of those idle trophy wives, but I thought magic was frowned upon in Amn. How did you get the chance to study it?~
@1317 = ~Well, there was obviously a rather generous amount of coinage that changed ownership in order to make it happen. Not that I'm proud of it, mind you. I admit that it's more than unfair that I got the chance just because I could afford it.~
@1318 = ~You shouldn't be ashamed of having been born under fortunate circumstances. At least you have the brains and the humility to realise that you have been given a chance most people could never dream of.~
@1319 = ~You must be relieved to have Lavok off your back, Valygar. Wizards are best kept at arm's length - at least until you figure out their true intentions.~
@1320 = ~Yes, I suppose I am relieved.~
@1321 = ~The man of many words is back again is he?~
@1322 = ~You are as puzzling as ever, Amber.~
@1323 = ~I wish no quarrel with you and yet you insist on insulting me.~
@1324 = ~I was simply trying to pick up a decent conversation on the topic of your disturbing family legacy, but you are not being very helpful.~
@1325 = ~There are things better left alone. You should know that as well as I do.~
@1326 = ~One blood, one heart - wouldn't you say, Amber? Tiefling lust burning hot already, is it not?~
@1327 = ~If you're suggesting what I think you are - you are gravely mistaken. While I cannot speak for the bard, I can assure you that I feel nothing of the kind.~
@1328 = ~That is what you claim, but I must say that you are one of the worst liars I have ever laid my eyes upon.~
@1329 = ~Which god do you follow, Amber? I would really like to know - i-if you're willing to share such information, that is.~
@1330 = ~I follow no power, be it mortal or divine, Aerie. I only follow my own path.~
@1331 = ~You follow no-one? H-How can you live like that?~
@1332 = ~Well, I'm used to taking care of myself. If I had counted on someone else to take care of me, I would have been dead many times over.~
@1333 = ~B-But who do you turn to when you're all alone and s-scared? When everything seems hopeless? If Uncle Quayle had not introduced me to Baervan, I-I don't know how I would have ever s-survived.~
@1334 = ~That's just it. I cannot turn to anyone. It's not necessarily that I don't want to, but that's just how it goes. You might have been dropped from the skies, but you still belong here, Aerie. But what respectable god would ever accept a demonspawn like me?~
@1335 = ~I don't know, Amber. P-Perhaps you're right, but I-I...~
@1336 = ~I don't believe that the gods would decline you because you are a tiefling, but rather because you don't *believe* it to be possible for them to accept you. If you have faith and courage, your true heart will speak for you, even in the face of the gods.~
@1337 = ~Well, you *can* speak up, after all... I will think about what you said, but I must admit that your words sound a bit too naive to coincide with the realities of this world. Then again, maybe I have just grown too bitter to see the possibility of salvation.~
@1338 = ~Ouch! Something in this damned, no-good bush bit me!~
@1339 = ~Oh, sorry Cernd - I did not see you there. Don't get me wrong, I don't really think this forest is 'damned', and I'd say that 'no-good' was a hasty overreaction as well. Something just suddenly bit me, that's all.~
@1340 = ~Hmmm... Your temper is like a sudden rain on a warm summer day. It is over just as quickly as it begun.~
@1341 = ~Let me take a look at that, bite.~
@1342 = ~Oh, don't worry it was just a small ant. The blistering should be gone in a matter of hours, but if it still bothers you when we set up camp tonight, I have a cooling salve that should ease it.~
@1343 = ~Well, I guess I at least learned a lesson from that ant: no matter how small something is, you can count on it to bite you good if you step on it.~
@1344 = ~That is true enough, but if you think more carefully, it is not the only thing you can learn. Far from it.~
@1345 = ~As you noted, ants are seemingly small and one might question that we could ever learn anything from such an insignificant creature. However, by their teamwork and perseverance, the tiny insects manage to build great cities, all the while remaining the harmony with their surroundings.~
@1346 = ~A wise man once told his followers to study the under-appreciated ant and learn from it when planning any great endeavour.~
@1347 = ~Well, teamwork has never been my speciality since I have been alone for most part of my life. Perhaps there is indeed is more to ants - and everything else, I guess - than meets the eye.~
@1348 = ~I have to admit that I admire the way you fight, Mazzy. I always try to maintain my distance and look for the right spot to dash in and then back away again, but you just charge right in and face the enemy eye to eye. Even though you are - well let's face it - we are both smaller than the average bad guy.~
@1349 = ~Why, thank you Amber. But although it is important to show courage and valour on the battlefield, a charge is not always the best option. My bow has taken down many enemies before they ever got within a sword's length of me.~
@1350 = ~Ah, your bow? Can I take look at it? The craftsmanship seems really amazing. What type of arrows do you prefer?~
@1351 = ~Well, what I really like to use - and I must say that many seasoned fighters will agree with me - is this.~
@1352 = ~Hard ashen shafts and narrow bodkins - I can see why you would prefer these. I, however, like to cut my fletching slightly differently from the basic triangle you use. Like this, you see - the swineback cut, as it's usually called.~
@1353 = ~I see. I take it that you use it because of its silent flight? Not much point for that on the battlefield, though.~
@1354 = ~I can imagine. I guess there's nothing quite like that fluttering sound of inevitable doom raining from the sky if you want to strike some fear into the hearts of your enemies.~
@1355 = ~It just doesn't have quite the same impact when there's only one of you. That's when swift, silent arrows carefully placed will be your best bet for staying alive.~
@1356 = ~Valygar, I am sorry if I seemed bit edgy last time we spoke. I do seem to have a knack for getting of to a bad start with people. Though you have to admit that you, on the other hand, are the not the most sociable of people. Anyway, I come to you with an offering of peace and a few questions only you can answer.~
@1357 = ~What did you have in mind, Amber?~
@1358 = ~Well, as you may have noticed, I can move around well enough without anybody noticing in urban surroundings and even in caves or dungeons, but forests and bushes seem to cause some trouble. You don't suppose that you could give me a few hints concerning that? In exchange I will promise to keep a more civil tone with you.~
@1359 = ~Well, I don't think that would be too much trouble - perhaps later when <CHARNAME> is not so busy?~
@1360 = ~Great! It's a date then.~

Wanted but good for all she'd meet.
But the blood in her veins
Never spared them from pains;
Will all her dreams end in defeat?"~
@2001 = ~How can you presume to know anything of me, fool?~
@2002 = ~Tee-hee hee!~
@2003 = ~I think it's good that we should help her, but I would rather not get mixed in the quarrels of the noble folk. We are no better than cattle to them.~
@2004 = ~Her niece seems nice enough, even if she's a bit naive, but this lady certainly gets on my nerves.~
@2005 = ~I'll wager there is more to this than we bargained for... At least this should prove interesting, judging from all the gold that noble is willing to pay us to take the bait.~
@2006 = ~<CHARNAME>, I've dealt with thieves' guilds before. Not in this city, but I don't think that the rules they play by are any different here than in the north. Should you cross them, you can consider yourself a dead man.~
@2007 = ~Or at least you'd better make *them* consider you a dead man, and never show your face anywhere near this city again.~
@2008 = ~In case you didn't figure it out yourself, I'd say that there is no coming back unless we make sure that things turn hostile. These people don't take kindly to traitors.~

@2010 = ~'Good use'? Had you made that 'profitable use', I would have no trouble believing you, but somehow I doubt that anything good can come out of your use of our gold.~
@2011 = ~Charity is an unlikely trait in a Shadowmaster. I expect we will end up paying dearly for these trinkets. With our blood, if with nothing else.~
@2012 = ~Sounds like a place I would rather not see from the inside. But on the other hand, chickening out now would mean missing one hell of an adventure.~
@2013 = ~<CHARNAME>, I hope that you find the time to speak to that woman.~
@2014 = ~I'm happy that you agreed to help them, <CHARNAME>. I hope that I will have a chance to talk with this Raelis again when we have found her lost actor. I have a lot of questions to ask her.~
@2015 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I think we should try to help them. Mutual kindness may not be the norm among tieflings, but I'd like to prove myself different.~
@2016 = ~You! Yes, you, vile brown-skinned elf! How dare you walk among us with your head held high!~
@2017 = ~A vile abomination! An elf with the eyes of a beast!~
@2018 = ~Lies! Swallow your pride, elf, and admit that you are a malicious creature of evil!~
@2019 = ~Could that be because I'm no elf?~
@2020 = ~I've been called many things and even been mistaken for an elf from afar, but you must be daft to think me an elf at this distance.~
@2021 = ~Tell me something I haven't heard before, oaf.~
@2022 = ~I grow quite tired of this conversation. I'll just leave you to your rabid delusions, then.~
@2023 = ~Hey! We don't serve your kind here. Get out of here!~
@2024 = ~Well, your money is no good here. You can go back to the Hells where you belong, fiendling. I don't want to see those weird eyes of yours here again.~
@2025 = ~Don't try to tell me how to run my business! I told you to leave, and you'd better do so before I call the guards.~
@2026 = ~Now let's calm down, everyone. I am sure we can sort this out.~
@2027 = ~I think we'd better leave...~
@2028 = ~Don't you threaten my friend, you fat cow!~
@2029 = ~You can't order me around in my own place! Take your companion and leave now. I'm not going to tell you again!~
@2030 = ~Perhaps a few gold coins would turn your head, ma'am? Just to show you how much we appreciate the services of this fine establishment.~
@2031 = ~I'll order around whomever I want and whenever I want! You'd better start serving us right about now, before I lose my temper!~
@2032 = ~GET OUT OF HERE!~
@2033 = ~Are you daft or something, boy? I said that creature's money is no good here, and just to make it clear to you, that includes her companions as well. Now get lost.~
@2034 = ~Are you daft or something, <GIRLBOY>? I said that creature's money is no good here...~
@2035 = ~But just out of curiosity... What kind of a sum are we talking about here?~
@2036 = ~I am sure 10 gold coins would do the trick, don't you agree?~
@2037 = ~How about 50 gold coins? Would that be enough to make you forget this little incident, ma'am?~
@2038 = ~Let's make it 100 gold coins and put all this behind us, all right?~
@2039 = ~Never mind, we'll just leave.~
@2040 = ~Are you making fun of me? I said that creature's money is no good here, and just to make it clear to you, that includes her companions as well. Now get lost.~
@2041 = ~Well, perhaps I can make an exception just this once. You can stay, as long as you don't make a scene.~
@2042 = ~Well, it's about time you did!~
@2043 = ~What are you waiting for? I told you to get out of my establishment.~
@2044 = ~Don't you start with that 'your kind' talk! To you I'm of the 'paying customer kind', just like everyone else in here.~
@2045 = ~With an attitude like yours, I don't see this place staying in business for long.~
@2046 = ~But his is? I'd say that his hair looks just a touch too blue for an elf, wouldn't you?~
@2047 = ~How about that imp you have upstairs? Certainly more fiendish than I could ever be.~
@2048 = ~I am totally calm! It's she who's jumping all over the place.~
@2049 = ~Greetings, my <LADYLORD>.  I am Madame Nin, and I am here to ensure you are pleasantly accompanied.  Are you interested in companionship, my <LADYLORD>?~
@2050 = ~I think you've found the wrong audience for your sales pitch, madame. We are definitely not interested in taking advantage of the poor girls you've enslaved here.~
@2051 = ~I think you've found the wrong audience for your sales pitch, madame. <CHARNAME> is definitely not interested in taking advantage of the poor girls you've enslaved here.~
@2052 = ~I think you've found the wrong audience for your sales pitch, madame. <PLAYER2> is definitely not interested in taking advantage of the poor girls you've enslaved here.~
@2053 = ~You are lost, child. And lost shall you remain, until you lose your fear of losing.~
@2054 = ~Well, that was quite a few 'losts' for such a short sentence.  But you know nothing of me, lady - I fear little and have even less to lose. Your words ring empty to me.~
@2055 = ~You gutless coward! You resort to cheap tricks and hide behind the backs of your lackeys. No wonder Jaheira despises you - any decent person would, even if you weren't a stinking slaver.~
@2056 = ~Poor ghost, left afraid and all alone in the dark... I could not bear such a fate. We have to find that bear of his, so he can finally rest in peace.~
@2057 = ~(sob!) I just want my bear back. (sob!) I'm so tired.~
@2058 = ~Stop being such an idiot, <CHARNAME>. It can't take that long to find Wellyn's bear - I say we go and look for it.~
@2059 = ~What do you mean 'we can't help him'? Of course we can help! If Wellyn needs his bear to sleep, the only thing we have to do is help him find it.~
@2060 = ~Judging from his symptoms, I think I know the poison that burns in his veins. We should hurry to his friends - there is an antidote, but it will be of no use if given too late.~
@2061 = ~<CHARNAME>! You are not leaving this man here to die! He's too heavy for me to carry, but together we can do it.~
@2062 = ~I have never encountered dryads before - such sweet and innocent looking creatures, it seems. I have always been told that they're monsters, but I guess that's what they say about any race that is not 'civilised'.~
@2063 = ~Oh, he's one of my kin! Well, at least as far as you can consider tieflings to be a 'kin'. After all, it has been said that no two are alike.~
@2064 = ~Personally, I can't wait to get rid of this ship and its crew. Jolly they may be, but the smell is just too much to take. After spending this long on board, I don't think we'll ever get it off of ourselves.~
@2065 = ~Personally I can't wait to get rid of this ship and its crew. Jolly they may be, but the smell is just too much to take. After spending this long on board, I don't think we'll ever get it off of ourselves.~
@2066 = ~That crooked, no-good sea-rat! How dare he sell us out to those bloodsuckers?~
@2067 = ~What could have broken this girl's mind so completely? I hope we can find a way to help her; it is sad for anyone to suffer like that.~
@2068 = ~Good enough for me. Go.~
@2069 = ~I am sorry. Please, be careful. I hope we'll meet up again.~
@2070 = ~Oh all right, join with me. We'll get out of here together.~
@2071 = ~You would come all this way just to abandon this girl? No, I will not have it. I'll go instead - I am more than capable of taking care of myself.~
@2072 = ~Don't worry, <CHARNAME>. I won't be mad at you - this will change nothing between us. Just let me get back alone, and take Imoen with you.~
@2073 = ~But not for me, <CHARNAME>. How can you abandon her here in a state like that? I'm not so sure that she's capable of getting out of here alone.~
@2074 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I think it's too dangerous for her to go alone. I'm not at all certain that she's up to it, not after what she has been though.~
@2075 = ~You should take her with us.~
@2076 = ~I think I know Imoen better than you do, Amber. She's much stronger than she looks - she'll be just fine.~
@2077 = ~There is no way you can make a judgement like that, not when you've only just met her. Imoen is much stronger than she looks and she'll be just fine.~
@2078 = ~Our journey is likely to be far more dangerous than Imoen's. It is me who Bodhi is after, remember? Imoen is far better off alone.~
@2079 = ~Perhaps you are right, Amber. It's better if you come with us, Imoen.~
@2080 = ~I wouldn't be so sure that she's still the same person you once knew after all she's been through here. On the other hand, if she survived that, perhaps she can find her way to the mainland just as well.~
@2081 = ~I still think that it's not the right thing to do, but if you are certain that you will be not be able to protect her from Bodhi, perhaps it is for the best. Though I'm still not quite comfortable leaving her here...~
@2082 = ~Fine, leave her then. I see that I have been somewhat mistaken about your character.~
@2083 = ~ I think that is the only decent thing to do, <CHARNAME>.~
@2084 = ~Oh, I haven't seen you before, have I. I would surely remember an exotic beauty such as yourself.~
@2085 = ~Come, I will buy you a drink, so that we can talk and get to know each other. Or would you rather retire to the privacy of my room straight away? The atmosphere there would be so much more intimate.~
@2086 = ~Ah, I just knew you could not resist my charms, and thus have returned to me.~
@2087 = ~How about that drink now, my angel? Or shall we go straight to my private quarters?~
@2088 = ~You should never say never, cupcake...~
@2089 = ~Who you think you are? And why would you think that I would be the least bit interested in you? Get lost!~
@2090 = ~You are unbelievably stubborn, oaf! Never speak to me again.~
@2091 = ~Not if you want to lose a limb, no. Now, get lost, creep.~
@2092 = ~Ugh... I never thought that I could look any freakier than I normally do, but now I know I was wrong.~
@2093 = ~Hmmm... On the other hand you actually look rather fetching with your new dark skin, Imoen.~
@2094 = ~Well, that makes two of us, then. But I have to admit I liked your eyes better the way they were. You just don't look at all like yourself with those dark orbs.~
@2095 = ~(Amber whispers.) Are you proud of what we have done? We murdered all those people.~
@2096 = ~No I'm not, Amber, but we had to accept those challenges. The Pit Master would have grown suspicious if we hadn't.~
@2097 = ~Murdered? Those were fair battles. Challenge announced, challenge accepted. We vanquished our enemies - I thought you would be proud of it.~
@2098 = ~Since when have you been a drow sympathiser, Amber? They are evil - all of them. They deserve to die.~
@2099 = ~We could have made an excuse. At least after the first one; we had already proved our mettle.~
@2100 = ~Proud of it? They were like leaves that we just brushed aside. They didn't have a chance and you know it. I think what we did was horrible - only cowards would prove their might by slaughtering those weaker than themselves like that.~
@2101 = ~Do you consider yourself so high and mighty that you can be the judge of others? It is not for you to decide who deserves to live and who does not.~
@2102 = ~Drow prey on the weak, but you should do better than that. Please, don't let the dragon's illusion become reality. I would hate for that to happen.~
@2103 = ~Don't give in to the murderous taint of Bhaal. It looked as if you enjoyed seeing those drow get killed. It's just not right, even if they are evil. We should never take pleasure in ending someone's life. Please try to remember that.~
@2104 = ~No, these gnomes are not evil! They even helped us! I will not take part in slaying them!~
@2105 = ~You are not simply going to murder him, are you? I am certain there is another way out of this.~
@2106 = ~<CHARNAME>, what is it? You look like you've seen a ghost and... you are trembling. Is something wrong? Should we stop for a rest?~ [m#amb457]
@2107 = ~No, it's nothing. Just leave me alone, Amber.~
@2108 = ~I... I just felt like I was going to faint for a moment there. It was probably an effect of Bodhi's spell, but I'm feeling just fine now.~
@2109 = ~I don't know. I felt really odd for a moment, there. Could you... hold me close for a moment, Amber? ~
@2110 = ~I don't know. I felt really odd for a moment, there. Could you... hold me close for a moment, Amber?~
@2111 = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>. Just make sure that you don't push yourself too far without resting.~
@2112 = ~But of course, <CHARNAME>. (Amber wraps her slender arms around you and rests her head on your chest.)~
@2113 = ~I don't see how that is going to help you get your vigour back. I suggest we rest before trying to figure out a way to get out of there.~
@2114 = ~What was that... monster? I - I have heard of the avatar of Bhaal... but I could not have imagined anything so horrifying. It was as if you lost all control of yourself and whatever took you over - you would have slain us all had we not run away.~ [m#amb458]
@2115 = ~You will *have* to learn to control that beast; it is bound to make another attempt to take you over. I will help you in any way I can - even if I can offer you little besides comfort and reassurance.~ [m#amb459]
@2116 = ~You are shivering, <CHARNAME>. Can I get you an extra blanket... no, this is not about the chill, is it? Come, let me hold you - perhaps I can give you some strength to fight whatever is ailing you.~ [m#amb460]
@2117 = ~No! Stay away, Amber. Please! I'm not in control of my actions!~
@2118 = ~Run! For your own sake, get the hell out of here!~

@2126 = ~You follow in the hopes of retrieving something dear to you. I say that the longer you keep this up, the more you will lose.~
@2127 = ~Now my, my, what is this? A little tiefling, her blood burning with lust and the fires of demonkind... A dangerous pet you have taken, <CHARNAME>. Be careful - you might burn yourself with her.~

@2152 = ~Amber, the wilful tiefling that you encountered in Athkatla, has grown very close with <PLAYER2>, your ever faithful companion. Her affection for him is obvious, but will that bond be strong enough for Amber to follow you to the desperate battle against Irenicus?~

@2154 = ~You should not be here, Amber. This is not your fight, but mine alone.~
@2155 = ~This is too dangerous, Amber. I don't want you risking you newfound happiness with <PLAYER2> for this.~
@2156 = ~Amber, the wilful tiefling you encountered in Athkatla has grown to be your trusted ally and a dear friend. The compassion she has shown has helped you survive the pain and emptiness caused by Irenicus stealing your soul.  Together you have seen many battles, but is she willing to follow you now, in the face of almost certain death?~
@2157 = ~This is too dangerous, I don't want you risking yourself for my sake.~
@2158 = ~Amber, the wilful tiefling you encountered in Athkatla has earned her place at your side many times over. Together you have seen many battles, but is she willing to follow you now, in the face of almost certain death?~
@2159 = ~This is too dangerous even for someone as capable as you, Amber.~
@2160 = ~Hush, love. As long as I can be with you here and now, I do not care whether we will live or die today. And should we fall, I promise we will take Irenicus with us.~ [m#amb464]
@2161 = ~I wish you'd already learned that you *can* count on me. I know that he will follow you no matter what, and I have no desire to part with him. Yet that is not the only reason I'm coming along.~ [m#amb465]
@2162 = ~No, that's where you're wrong. I know that he will follow you no matter what, and I have no desire to part with him. Yet that is not the only reason I'm coming along.~ [m#amb466]
@2163 = ~Love itself is but a gamble against all odds, but I'm happy that I took that risk with <PLAYER2>. I know that he will follow you no matter what, and I have no desire to part with him. Yet that is not the only reason I'm coming along.~ [m#amb467]
@2164 = ~<CHARNAME>, you know better than well that that you *can* trust me. That's what friends are for, after all. To be there when you need them the most. And I am proud that I can call you my friend, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb468]
@2165 = ~There is more to it than friendship, though.~
@2166 = ~No, that's where you're wrong. Is this not what friends are for? To be there for you when you need them the most. I am proud that I can call you my friend, <CHARNAME>, and I love you for accepting that friendship. I have met many who have not given me the chance.~ [m#amb469]
@2167 = ~However, there is more than our friendship that draws me to this battle.~
@2168 = ~But I will and you know that. That's what friends are for after all: to be there when you need them the most. I m really glad that I can call you my friend, <CHARNAME> and I love you for accepting that friendship. I have met many who have not been so willing to do that.~ [m#amb470]
@2169 = ~I wish you'd already learned that you *can* count on me. If you have that little faith in me, how do you expect me to do my part here?~ [m#amb471]
@2170 = ~I should be able to trust you too, you know.~
@2171 = ~My apologies, Amber. I do trust you, but I suppose that I just wanted to say that this would be the time to leave, should you feel that this is not your fight.~
@2172 = ~My apologies, Amber. I do trust you, but I need to know that you are not doing this for the wrong reasons.~
@2173 = ~Then what are you waiting for? If you're not sure that you can trust me, there is no way that I can take you into what we are about to face.~
@2174 = ~Let me be the judge of that, will you?~ [m#amb472]
@2175 = ~No, I have my own reasons to come with you, even if they have little to with your charming personality.~
@2176 = ~No, this is not just about your revenge, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb473]
@2177 = ~You are right, I should have left a long time ago. I always did feel somewhat uneasy around you and I should have known better than to ignore my instincts.~
@2178 = ~When I see what this Irenicus has done to you and to these elves and think of what he can do if he goes unchallenged.... I would never forgive myself if I didn't try to stop him.~
@2179 = ~I'm staying by your side, whether you wish it or not.~
@2180 = ~I am ready - lead on, <CHARNAME>.~
@2181 = ~What just happened? Why... Why did we end up here, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb474]
@2182 = ~I guess there is a reason for us being here, but I would not want to stay here any longer than necessary. Let's get going.~ [m#amb475]
@2183 = ~Come on, you don't seriously believe that you have a chance here, mageling?~
@2184 = ~My companion, Amber.~
@2185 = ~Hey! Where are you taking that man?~
@2186 = ~Aaaah... Good miss please help me... Please!~
@2187 = ~Silence! If you weren't worth more with your tongue still in your mouth, I'd have it cut out.~
@2188 = ~What is it to you girl? Get lost before you get in trouble.~
@2189 = ~I'm not going anywhere until...~
@2190 = ~You looking for a fight?~
@2191 = ~Yeah! Iv yer lookin' ta getin ye throat slit yer in da righ place.~
@2192 = ~Why don't you learn to speak first, and then come shoot your lip at me!~
@2193 = ~Boy, do I smell a rat here, <CHARNAME>. What foul tricks are you up to now, Viconia?~ [m#amb481]
@2194 = ~There is no need to get upset just because I say something you dare not, Amber.~
@2195 = ~<CHARNAME>, I have just expressed my admiration over you form, do not just stand there gawking. It does not become you.~
@2196 = ~Truly?  You find me desirable, do you?~
@2197 = ~I don't have time for such talk, Viconia.  Keep your eyes to yourself.~
@2198 = ~Poorly?~ [m#amb482]
@2199 = ~Come on, don't be so modest - I am sure you could understate it even more than that.~ [m#amb483]
@2200 = ~Mind your own business, fool. I will deal with your arrogance later.~
@2201 = ~Now, before that creature makes me lose my patience, will you accept my apology, <CHARNAME>?~
@2202 = ~You?  Apologize?  The great and haughty Viconia?~
@2203 = ~(sigh) Is it not enough that I permit you to accompany us that I must put up with your constant drivel?~
@2204 = ~Another tale of murder and deceit, is it Viconia?~ [m#amb484]
@2205 = ~Had our parts been reversed with you fleeing into the depths of my native realm, you would not have lasted a day. Only those who are strong have a chance of surviving in the Underdark, and weaklings like you...~
@2206 = ~ Well I really don't think that you have the stomach to hear the excruciating details of your certain demise.~
@2207 = ~Just try me.~
@2208 = ~No, I don't have time for you, or your stupidity. Be gone now.~
@2209 = ~Fine, I'm not interested in your story anyway.~
@2210 = ~So, <CHARNAME>, now that the babbling fool has been dealt with, are you willing to hear me out?~
@2211 = ~Yes, please tell your tale.~
@2212 = ~I'm not interested in another one of your stories, Viconia.~
@2213 = ~Not now... tell me some other time, perhaps.~
@2214 = ~Your life is entirely in your own hands. If you don't like it the way it is, you should do something about it and not just wait for <CHARNAME> to change it for you.~ [m#amb488]
@2215 = ~But... But I-I was not asking <CHARNAME> to do anything for me. I just asked what he w-wanted.~
@2216 = ~Then, by all means, do so, but you have made it more than obvious what you want him to answer.~
@2217 = ~T-That was not my intent. I... I am just so tired of all this killing. Don't you ever just want to stop, <CHARNAME>? ~
@2218 = ~Aye, I do.  Nothing would please me more than to stop all this violence.~
@2219 = ~Sometimes battle is required, Aerie... it is not something that I have a choice about.~
@2220 = ~Struggle and combat bring strength, Aerie... and I have needed all my strength just to survive!~
@2221 = ~More whining, Aerie?  Please keep it to yourself, will you?~
@2222 = ~Hey, are you one of them circus folk? You sure look weird enough to be. Not that you'd be worth the ticket though. They'll have to come up with something more interesting than that.~
@2223 = ~I really don't care if you don't find me interesting or not, boy. And besides, I have nothing to do with this circus.~
@2224 = ~You must be the prettiest redheaded elf I have ever seen. There would not happen to be any room in your calendar, for...~
@2225 = ~By the Nine Hells! You are no elf! Get away from me!~
@2226 = ~You get away from me! It's not as if it was me who came on to you!~
@2227 = ~Erm... Did I just see that thing on your arm move? That cannot be true. It is unnatural!~
@2228 = ~Well, in that case it must have been your eyes playing tricks on you. ~
@2229 = ~When I'm in the army we'll be crushing all freaks and deviants like you! Yes, we will! I'm going to join the army, you know.~
@2230 = ~I'm sure they'll be delighted to have you - blind enthusiasm is exactly what they are looking for. I bet that they'll put you right into the front ranks.~
@2231 = ~Oh, my... How is it that you manage to keep your hair in such a nice shape, my girl? This weather is just murder to mine.~
@2232 = ~Just keep your hands away from my hair, missy!~
@2233 = ~Eww... You are not a little girl... Get away from me, you freak!~
@2234 = ~Hey! Can I have eyes like that? I wanna! My father's real rich and he'll get me anything I want.~
@2235 = ~I would be all for trading my eyes for yours, boy. If the whole idea wasn't completely idiotic, that is.~
@2236 = ~They been letting everyone out of the jail, I see! Even you. I heard them say you are a demon. I don't know what will come of this city if they let demons run loose on the streets!~
@2237 = ~Idiot... If there truly were demons running loose on the streets, you would be faring a lot worse.~
@2238 = ~I.. I don't think I'm feeling too well. I wonder if there a storm coming? Can you feel it too?~
@2239 = ~I sure don't feel anything out of the ordinary. Must be just in your head.~
@2240 = ~It getting worse! Not only are demi-humans overrunning our fair city, but demi-fiends too! Curse all you pointy-ears! ~
@2241 = ~Go preach your prejudice somewhere else, dolt.~
@2242 = ~Eow! What's wrong with your arm? That tattoo thing is moving!~
@2243 = ~Just get lost, brat...~
@2244 = ~This is just downright outrageous! Why do the guards let all this rabble here? Someone is clearly not up to his task. Your kind should never be allowed to enter the respectable districts.~
@2245 = ~Well, if it makes you feel any better, I'm not exactly comfortable sharing the same district with *your* kind, either.~
@2246 = ~Please me Lady, could ye spare a coin for a beggar in dire need?~
@2247 = ~Sure. Here, take this.~
@2248 = ~Agh...Y'are no elf or no human neither! I don't want to take ya' gold. No, keep it - I dare not take it. I'm cursed enough as it is. Just get away from me, evil one!~
@2249 = ~Don't ye be givin' me ship that evil eye of yours, girlie! I know a thing or two about yer kind, stormbringer! I bet all that bad weather I've been havin' is due one of one of yer kind givin' me ship the eye.~
@2250 = ~I've been looking at no ships, mate. If you've got bad luck, it must be due your foul manners.~
@2251 = ~Ye be a odd bird, redhead. Not that I mind, I like em in w'evar shape 'n' colour they come. How 'bout it - two coppers should do fine, awright? I bet there aren't a lot of takers for ye.~
@2252 = ~See this blade on my hip? Its point is the closest you'll ever get to my charms. So why don't you just get lost before I'll introduce you to each other, skunk.~
@2253 = ~It's a demon! It is! I'll wager me head for it! Never saw a fouler thing!~
@2254 = ~The pleasure of seeing the foulest thing ever is all mine, dwarf.~
@2255 = ~You-You would not be something that escaped from the wizard Mae'Var has been hosting, would you?~
@2256 = ~I've escaped from a lot of places and people, but I don't think that wizard is one of them.~
@2257 = ~Oh, my! There is a murderer on the loose and yet they let creatures like you walk free! The guards must be really busy indeed.~
@2258 = ~Well, if it's this murderer of yours that is keeping the guards from pestering me for things is did not do, I think I owe him my thanks.~
@2259 = ~Aaaaaeei! What's wrong with your eyes? Y-you haven't murdered anyone, have you? Flaying people is certainly a monster's work. A monster... or a demon? W-what was it that my uncle said about the eyes of a demon?~
@2260 = ~Well, I could certainly think of a reason why somebody would want to flay *you* alive.~
@2261 = ~Go away you... you thing. You are scaring away my customers.~
@2262 = ~Not only your customers, I see.~
@2263 = ~MY MOTHER SAYS THAT ALL DEVIANTS SHOULD BE SENT TO SPELLHOLD!~
@2264 = ~Well, I'll see you there, then.~
@2265 = ~This is holy ground you walk on, fiendling, or whatever you are. You should not be here.~
@2266 = ~And why not? Don't you think your god would strike me down if he disapprove of me?~
@2267 = ~Hey, you with the red hair... Have the Cowled ones turned a blind eye on a deviant again? They should be more careful.~
@2268 = ~Blind eye indeed...~
@2269 = ~Oh! The doomsday is surely upon us when fiends walk the earth in broad daylight! Lathander help us!~
@2270 = ~This is just the reason why I don't usually visit these parts of the city. Too many crazy people.~
@2271 = ~Lathander be blessed! Is there a curse upon you, woman? I am sure a priest of the Morninglord could help you with your affliction.~
@2272 = ~I doubt that there will ever be a cleric of any god that can help me. And I don't think I need your advice, either.~

@3000 = ~Oooo... You have to see this! They've captured a live demon!~ [M#GIRL1]
@3001 = ~Yes there is! My brother says he has a friend whose dad's seen one!~ [M#GIRL2]
@3002 = ~What are you talking about, girl? Spit it out!~
@3003 = ~A demon you say? That sounds interesting - tell me more.~
@3004 = ~No! Not unless you give me 100 gold!~ [M#GIRL3]
@3005 = ~Tell me now unless you want to get yourself hurt!~
@3006 = ~What if I just give you these 5 gold pieces?~
@3007 = ~Okay, here you go lassie.~
@3008 = ~Please don't hurt me! I'll tell you right away, my <LADYLORD>! I know for sure that the city guard captured a *real* demon this afternoon on Waukeen's Promenade. The cowled ones said it's no mage, but that it's dangerous, and ordered it to be locked up.~ [M#GIRL4]
@3009 = ~Wow! Thank you, my <LADYLORD>! Anyway I heard that the city guard captured a *real* demon this afternoon on Waukeen's Promenade. The cowled ones said it's no mage, but that it's dangerous, and ordered it to be locked up.~ [M#GIRL5]
@3010 = ~Wow, I've never seen so much gold before! Thank you, my <LADYLORD>!  Well anyway, what I heard was that the city guard captured a *real* demon this afternoon on Waukeen's Promenade. My brother and his friends saw it. The cowled ones said it's no mage, but that it can be dangerous, and ordered it to be locked up just to be sure.~ [M#GIRL6]
@3011 = ~My brother saw the guards drag it to the city prison.~ [M#GIRL7]
@3012 = ~No way, I don't believe you. My momma says there's no such thing as demons.~ [M#BOY1]
@3013 = ~Hey! Who are you? I bet you're not even supposed to be here, so just take a hike, will ya!~
@3014 = ~I want to talk to the prison keeper. Where can I find him?~
@3015 = ~Watch your tone, soldier! I'm from the Amnish Inquisition for Demonic and Unnatural Forces and I'm here for the demon you captured earlier.~
@3016 = ~No need to shout, my good man. I just happened to hear that a captured demon was being held in this prison, and I wondered if you could tell me something about it.~
@3017 = ~Give me the demon or I'll...~
@3018 = ~I'm here to liberate the poor creature you hold here, as it is obvious that it cannot be a demon. If it was, it would have already escaped and killed you all.~
@3019 = ~Alright, I'll go.~
@3020 = ~I'm here to see Jan Jansen.~
@3021 = ~He ain't around right now. Come back later if you got business with 'im.~
@3022 = ~Eh, you mean the gnome? You've come to pay his fine then or what?~
@3023 = ~Yes, I would like to pay his fine.~
@3024 = ~He would like to think so but I am not planning to pay his way out of jail.~
@3025 = ~All right, lemme think... That would be 800 gold then.~
@3026 = ~I'm afraid that I don't have enough gold right now.~
@3027 = ~I've changed my mind. Enjoy your day!~
@3028 = ~Here is your gold.~
@3029 = ~Then stop waisting my time. The bloody gnome is getting on my nerves bad enough already, without ya adding to it. Now, get going, will ya.~
@3030 = ~That's too bad. The bloody gnome is getting on my nerves real quick. Now, get going, will ya.~
@3031 = ~Excellent! He is free so, please, take him and go.~
@3032 = ~Eh, never heard of such a thing, but what would I know. Whaddaya want... ummm... <SIRMAAM>?~
@3033 = ~If you could give me an accurate description of this supposed demon, for starters, it would be most helpful.~
@3034 = ~I am here to retrieve the demon you have captured for further investigation and experimentation. I have direct orders from the Grand Inquisitor to escort the creature to our headquarters as quickly as possible.~
@3035 = ~Where is this supposed demon you hold? I need to see it immediately.~
@3036 = ~Uh... I don't think I'm s'posed to discuss this with you, but I guess there'll be no harm in telling you.~
@3037 = ~Or you'll what? Don't you try to scare ol' Max into lettin' you in.~
@3038 = ~Now, now, you got me all wrong. I was just about to tell you that if you cannot be of help in this matter, then I shall have to go to your superiors.~
@3039 = ~Oh, but you will be scared... Kill the fool.~
@3040 = ~I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to... I'll just be going now.~
@3041 = ~Well, it's the strangest little critter I've seen in my entire life. It's got red hair that looks like it's been blessed by Sune herself. And the little thing is HOT - it's always as if it has a fever or sumthing. And when I say little, I don't mean to tell you it wouldn't be strong, no sirree.~
@3042 = ~By the gods, it's sure got loads of strength and anger packed into that small frame. It's quick too, but that's not all. The most disturbing thing are its eyes - two amber orbs that'll burn right through ya. They're no human eyes, mark my words. I mean, not even the blacks of 'em are normal, not like yours or mine, but more like a cat's or something - I dunno.~
@3043 = ~And besides, the creature can wield some really spooky magic; earlier it took just one look at my fella Nick and poof! We thought that he'd be blind for good. It did wear off eventually, but I'm not taking any chances with that one, that's for sure.~
@3044 = ~Could I see this creature for myself?~
@3045 = ~Seems like a clear case of demonic contamination. Take me to the creature and I will deal with it accordingly.~
@3046 = ~ Judging from your description, this creature is no demon but actually a tiefling - a half-breed that has some demonic influence somewhere in its bloodline. They can be quite dangerous if they wish but most of the time they're nothing like true demons.~
@3047 = ~Nope, I like my head too much. Boss would flay me if he knew I'd taken bribes. Get the form and we'll talk again.~
@3048 = ~Umm, yeah. See you around.~
@3049 = ~Hey, you gain nothing by threatening me. Just get the form and we'll talk again.~
@3050 = ~Well, I don't really know what it is, for real, but I sure can't let you set it free. Not without proper authorisation, at least. And I doubt you'd be gettin' one, knowin' how the people at the council do their work.~
@3051 = ~Proper authorisation? What would I need if I wanted to take a look at this creature, then?~
@3052 = ~I have plenty of authorisation right here in my hand, see. Better let me in to see the creature or you'll be taking a lot closer look at my 'authorisation'.~
@3053 = ~Don't you try to scare ol' Max into lettin' you in. It ain't gonna work.~
@3054 = ~Now, now, no need to get hostile. I was just pointing out that I am quite adequately equipped to face this creature you have in custody. ~
@3055 = ~Well, I s'pose if you had the right form, signed and stamped by the due authorities, I could do something for ya. Form 1567, if I remembers it right. Your best bet would probably be goin' to Chief Inspector Brega - you'll need his seal for the form anyway. If you had that, hell, I could even dump the critter on you and be rid of it myself. It's nothin' but a load of trouble, I'll tell ya.~
@3056 = ~I would not care to be thrown into the jaws of bureaucracy. Perhaps 100 gold pieces would make you reconsider?~
@3057 = ~A form from Chief Inspector Brega you say? That does not sound too hard. I'll be back in a moment.~
@3058 = ~Listen pal. You will release that creature to me now, or face the consequences.~
@3059 = ~You got the papers, then? You must know that I can't let you in to see the critter unless you got the right form properly filled out.~
@3060 = ~And what form would that be?~
@3061 = ~Look, I've got the strictest of orders and if you don't show me to the creature right away, I'll...~
@3062 = ~Now that's an idea. Why don't you just go and bother someone else and leave me alone. Chief Inspector Brega's the one who handles all the paperwork for these weirdos we have here. Just tell him you need Form 1567 signed and stamped to help me get rid of both you and the little redheaded bastard.~
@3063 = ~It'd be form number 1567, if I remembers it right. Your best bet would probably be goin' to Chief Inspector Brega. If you had that, hell, I could even dump the critter on you and be rid of it myself. It's just load of trouble, I'll tell ya.~
@3064 = ~You'll not get away with this! Raise the alarm!~
@3065 = ~You again! Why do you keep bothering me?~
@3066 = ~I really need to see the demon you have here. Isn't there any way you could let me see it?~
@3067 = ~Sorry, didn't mean to bother you. I'll just leave now, OK?~
@3068 = ~I told you, I can't help you unless you get the form from the Chief Inspector.~
@3069 = ~All right, I believe you.~
@3070 = ~Oh it's you again. Sooner than I expected.~
@3071 = ~Here are the papers. Everything should be in order now.~
@3072 = ~Actually I still have some things to take care of. I'll be back in a moment.~
@3073 = ~Oh well, I wouldn't know. Can't read, you see. But these look official enough. I think I'd better give you the stuff the demon had with it when we captured it as well. I trust you got the form for that in them papers? Of course you do, it would have been silly of you not to get that one too. So-oo, here you go.~
@3074 = ~I'll just open the door for you, now.~
@3075 = ~Hey, where's my key? You've stolen it! Raise the alarm!~
@3076 = ~Okay, you little creature, you can go with these people now.~
@3077 = ~Get lost, bitch. I don't know what you're talkin' about.~
@3078 = ~Why you little...~
@3079 = ~Amber! Try to behave, will you?~
@3080 = ~I see where this is going. Would you let me do the talking, Amber?~
@3081 = ~Amber, stop that! I'm sorry about that, sir. We'll just be on our way now.~
@3082 = ~Huh? You're with this girl? (The guard eyes you and your gear suspiciously. Slowly he seems to come to the conclusion that it would be appropriate to switch to a more polite tone.) Hey, haven't I seen you somewhere, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
@3083 = ~I was here earlier and this woman was released under my surveillance. I got her gear but it seems that there was a bracelet missing.~
@3084 = ~Just hand over the bracelet, so that we can get this over with.~
@3085 = ~I wouldn't know nothing about no bracelet, anyhow. Nick's the one who's responsible for all of the prisoners' possessions, but he's off duty right now. Probably drinking 'imself under the table at the Sea's Bounty.~
@3086 = ~I wouldn't know anything about no bracelet, anyhow. Nick's the one who's responsible for all of the prisoners' possessions, but he's off duty right now. Probably drinking 'imself under the table at the Sea's Bounty.~
@3087 = ~No ma'am, I'm tellin' you the truth. If anyone here knows anythin' about yer things, it'll be Nick.~
@3088 = ~I already told you; Nick's the one you'll have to ask. I know nothin' about no bracelet.~
@3089 = ~You can't. He's busy, and he left *me* in charge, so beat it.~
@3090 = ~You're here for the gnome? Are you going to pay his fine then or what?~
@3091 = ~Good for you. That would be 900 gold then.~
@3092 = ~Then stop waisting my time. The bloody gnome is getting on my nerves is bad enough already, without ya adding to it. Now, get going, will you.~
@3093 = ~That's too bad. The bloody gnome is getting on my nerves really quickly. Now, get going, will you.~
@3094 = ~(Hic) Whaddaya want?~
@3095 = ~Your friend Ed told me that you are responsible for the prisoners' belongings. Seems that you 'forgot' to return something to me. A bracelet to be more specific.~
@3096 = ~Your friend Ed told me that you are responsible for the prisoners' belongings. Seems that you have 'forgotten' to return something to this woman here. A bracelet, to be more specific.~
@3097 = ~You have something that does not belong to you. Hand over the bracelet or suffer the consequences.~
@3098 = ~I've no idea what yer talking 'bout, mate. Ed's hardly me friend so he might jus' be pulling yer leg, if ya know what I mean.~
@3099 = ~Oh, sorry about the disturbance then, I'll just go see him again.~
@3100 = ~Don't try to feed lies to me, you scumbag. Hand over the bracelet. Now!~
@3101 = ~Yeah... Off ya go then. Come back later and buy me a drink will ya?~
@3102 = ~Hey don't ya get so excited. I have no bracelet. I sold it to a fence at the thieves' guild. She's always interested in such pretty items.~
@3103 = ~I should have you locked up for dealing in stolen goods, you know.~
@3104 = ~Well, good bye then. I sure hope that our paths will not cross again.~
@3105 = ~And I should have this little redhead of yours put away for being a deviant. As you well ought to know, illegal magic is frowned upon in this city.~
@3106 = ~And I should have you put away for good for being a deviant and irritating to boot. As you well ought to know, illegal magic is frowned upon in this city.~
@3107 = ~Somehow this lowlife doesn't seem to be as drunk or stupid as he pretends to be, <CHARNAME>...~
@3108 = ~I already told ya, I don't have the damn bracelet anymore. Sold it to the Guild I did. Now get lost and leave me to my drink before I arrest you.~
@3109 = ~Ah, there you are, tiefling. I have been looking for you.~
@3110 = ~My master has some very urgent business with you.~
@3111 = ~That is inconsequential. You will meet him soon enough.~
@3112 = ~You! Although I must thank you for destroying my predecessor Haegan, I am afraid I will not take very kindly to you barging in here. When will you learn to leave our business alone?~
@3113 = ~Never! I will destroy every single one of you despicable scum. There shall be no slave trading in Athkatla as long as I'm here to stop it! Now draw steel, you cur!~
@3114 = ~You brought this upon yourself. The fate of your predecessor should have been warning enough. You just sealed your fate by kidnapping our friend.~
@3115 = ~As soon as you tell me where have you taken Amber. We are not interested in your other activities, but kidnapping our friend was a mistake on your part.~
@3116 = ~Hah! So you're out to save the world, are you? Your pathetic little quest for good shall end here! You will see that in the end, my kind will always prevail. Destroy them!~
@3117 = ~We shall see about that. I am not afraid of your kind. Kill them!~
@3118 = ~Your friend is no longer here. She is of no personal interest to me, merely a way to make some extra gold. She has already been delivered to her new owner, whose identity is of no consequence to you, as you will not be leaving here alive. Kill 'em, men!~
@3119 = ~This is private property, dear stranger - I suggest that you leave immediately.~ [m#lor015]
@3120 = ~Please, just a moment of your time, lady. I'm looking for the home of a sorcerer called Ymmyrt.~
@3121 = ~Don't you get pushy with me missy. I demand to know who owns this house.~
@3122 = ~Out of my way, bitch. This must be the place I'm looking for, and even if it's not, I might just as well take a look inside.~
@3123 = ~Fine. I'll leave, if you insist.~
@3124 = ~What? How do you know that name?~ [m#lor016]
@3125 = ~No matter. I'm not going to repeat my warning: leave NOW, for your own sake.~ [m#lor018]
@3126 = ~No. I'm not going anywhere before you tell me if Ymmyrt lives here or not.~
@3127 = ~Perhaps I should teach you a thing or two about courtesy - the hard way.~
@3128 = ~No need to get agitated; perhaps we could sit down and talk about this?~
@3129 = ~Alright, I'll heed your warning. See? I'm already leaving.~
@3130 = ~I'm not going to repeat this warning: leave NOW, for your own sake.~ [m#lor017]
@3131 = ~I warned you, stranger, but you leave me no choice but to slay you. Men, attack them! Go for the strongest first, perhaps the others will flee.~ [m#lor019]
@3132 = ~No! Stranger, please hear my plea before you end my misery!~ [m#lor020]
@3133 = ~Very well, I will listen - but make it quick.~
@3134 = ~You dare to beg for your life after you just attacked me, woman?~
@3135 = ~No, I will not hear any of your pitiful pleas.~
@3136 = ~Yes, I beg for my life, good stranger. And not only that but for a life of another. Will you hear me out?~ [m#lor021]
@3137 = ~This is indeed the home of Ymmyrt the sorcerer, and I, Lorraine - cleric and ranger of Mielikki - am a slave of that vile man. He... that snake ...holds hostage the soul of my son and blackmails me into obedience.~ [m#lor022]
@3138 = ~I suppose you wish me to free his soul so that you may both be at peace?~
@3139 = ~Let me guess: you want me to set both mommy and son free? Cute. What would be in it for me?~
@3140 = ~A touching story - but I believe none of it. Prepare to meet your death!~
@3141 = ~My son, he... he is already dead, but as long as Ymmyrt holds his soul, he cannot truly pass beyond this world and join his forefathers. I cannot allow that - I beg you to free him. I can give you little but a wardstone to allow you entrance to his apartment and some advice as to what you should expect to find once inside.~ [m#lor023]
@3142 = ~However, Ymmyrt has collected many treasures and you have the look of a seasoned adventurer, or at least you fight like one. Perhaps you may find some of his items useful. Of course, it can all be yours even if you slay me here. But I care not - as long as you set my son free.~
@3143 = ~Very well, I will help you, but I'm curious: have you not tried to free your son by yourself?~
@3144 = ~I will see if I can find your son's soul, but I can't promise anything.~
@3145 = ~I do not trust you, but if I find this gem you speak of, it will perhaps verify your tale.~
@3146 = ~Thank you gentle knight, you are most kind.~
@3147 = ~I truly thank you, stranger. I will forever be in your debt. I have tried to get the gem that holds my poor child's soul from the sorcerer's private sleeping quarters, but they are guarded by a demon that I have not been able to defeat.~ [m#lor024]
@3148 = ~Every time I have tried, the demon has left me bloody and battered - barely alive. Every time it has mocked me while I lay there in my misery, dying, until Ymmyrt has come and restored my life force so that I can once more try to vanquish his demon while he laughs at my feeble attempts.~ [m#lor025]
@3149 = ~I must warn you stranger; it is a terrible beast from the infernal realms. You will come to see this when you face him. Will you now in turn answer a question for me? Why do you seek Ymmyrt the sorcerer in the first place? Certainly it was not by accident that you wandered here. Perhaps I can help you to find what you're looking for; I know his household well.~ [m#lor026]
@3150 = ~Some slavers captured a friend of mine and I learned that they sold her to Ymmyrt. She is a tiefling who goes by the name of Amber.~
@3151 = ~My business with Ymmyrt is none of your concern.~
@3152 = ~Oh, her. Quite a feisty one, isn't she? It took three of Ymmyrt's henchmen to hold her down - she has a true warrior's spirit. Ymmyrt holds her in a room above his laboratory, but you need a key from his bedchamber to get to the laboratory.~
@3153 = ~As you wish, stranger. Your business with Ymmyrt is truly between the two of you, but I'm guessing that it won't be a friendly meeting. You are likely to find him in his laboratory - you will need a key from his bedchamber to get there.~
@3154 = ~But you won't get even to his private quarters without a wardstone to unlock the magic protecting the stairs. Here, you can have this one.~
@3155 = ~I have a way to access his laboratory by other means. I will meet you there and help you defeat him if you bring my son's soul gem with you. Good luck!~ [m#lor027]
@3156 = ~Thank you, good stranger. I am most grateful for your kindness. When you have the key and the gem, I will meet you in Ymmyrt's basement. Farewell until then.~
@3157 = ~You do not have the gem, stranger! You would not help a grieving mother? Very well, so be it. I shall retrieve the gem myself.~ [m#lor032]
@3158 = ~You have the gem! Mielikki be blessed! Thank you, truly! Now, come, we must rid this world of Ymmyrt's evil, so that he can never again torture another soul.~ [m#lor028]
@3159 = ~But I would ask your name first, good stranger. If I am to fight alongside you, it would be good to know what you are called.~ [m#lor029]
@3160 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>, and I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Lorraine.~
@3161 = ~I'm called <CHARNAME>, but I'm not sure if I want to drag you to the battle with me - you might get hurt.~
@3162 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. But enough of this, the battle awaits! There is a device in the sorcerer's laboratory that I need to use to release my son's soul from the gem.~ [m#lor030]
@3163 = ~I fear neither death nor pain, <CHARNAME>, and I will have to battle Ymmyrt with you whether you like it or not. There is a device in the sorcerer's laboratory that I need to use to release my son's soul from the gem. But enough of this, the battle awaits!~ [m#lor031]
@3164 = ~You hold power over me no more, Ymmyrt. <CHARNAME> has in <PRO_HISHER> kindness retrieved the soul gem. Your demon is dead, and you too will fall today, sorcerer!~ [m#lor033]
@3165 = ~Dear child, I'm so happy that you're finally free. But without the help of <CHARNAME> that might have never happened.~ [m#lor035]
@3166 = ~It... it has been so long... I have been a slave for so long. Horrible things have happened since, and without you, <CHARNAME>, they still would. May Mielikki bless you as she once blessed me. I will content myself with praying that some day she might look kindly upon me once again.~ [m#lor036]
@3167 = ~It will be a long road for me to set my life right again and correct the wrongs I have caused, but you have helped me to take the first steps on that path. I will be in your debt for the rest of my life.~
@3168 = ~I know naught but your name, but the kindness you have shown me tells more than a thousand words. I have been truly blessed in meeting you, <CHARNAME> - do not think me ungrateful even if I can never repay you.~ [m#lor037]
@3169 = ~I will take my leave now, but you will most probably find your friend the tiefling in a room at the end of that flight of stairs. Walk in peace, <CHARNAME>.~
@3170 = ~I will now take my leave and let you take care of whatever business you had here. Walk in peace, <CHARNAME>.~
@3171 = ~So, another lesson in vanity and foolishness has come to an end. Only one last task remains to be done before I can leave this place forever.~ [m#lor034]
@3172 = ~So, you must be the troublemakers Ymmyrt mentioned. We have been expecting you. I don't know why you have come and I don't really care. I am here just to make sure you don't go any further.~
@3173 = ~Um, maybe I'll just be on my way then. Sorry for the inconvenience.~
@3174 = ~Take me to your master and I might let you live.~
@3175 = ~That is unfortunate for you, because I will not let you stand in my way. Surrender or die!~
@3176 = ~You and your evil master shall fall by my hand!~
@3177 = ~I'm afraid it is rather too late for that. Kill them, men!~
@3178 = ~Unfortunately, that is not to be. Your quest for the mighty Ymmyrt will end here.~
@3179 = ~Hah, we will never surrender! Attack them!~
@3180 = ~We shall see about that! Attack!~
@3181 = ~What's all that racket? Can't a man enjoy his bath in peace? Wha...Hey, you're not supposed to be here!~
@3182 = ~I have no quarrel with you, man. I am here for your employer, the sorcerer named Ymmyrt. Tell me where he is and I will spare your life.~
@3183 = ~Where is Ymmyrt, you lout? Take me to him now!~
@3184 = ~And what is a man in his underwear going to do about that?~
@3185 = ~I go where I please - and now I'm here to kill you.~
@3186 = ~His quarters are upstairs, but you can go there no more than I can. It is warded and you'll only get your head split if you try to go there.~
@3187 = ~I should have known you'd be of no use to me. I will find a way to him nevertheless. Now cover yourself and get out of my sight.~
@3188 = ~I should have known you'd be of no use to me. I will find a way to him nevertheless. However, I cannot let you go, so prepare to meet your death.~
@3189 = ~Such wards will not hold me. Now cover yourself and get out of my sight.~
@3190 = ~Such wards will not hold me, you pathetic fool. Now prepare for the end of your puny existence.~
@3191 = ~You know nothing of what I can or cannot do. Begone or I will be forced to kill you.~
@3192 = ~You wouldn't take advantage of a man's vulnerable situation, now would you? Surely you will let an unarmed man go. What threat could I possibly pose to you?~
@3193 = ~Absolutely none. You are right about that. Now begone before my amusement wears off and I reconsider my decision.~
@3194 = ~Absolutely none. Unfortunately for you, I cannot have you tipping off your master, so prepare to meet your end.~
@3195 = ~You never know. I'd better kill you just to be sure.~
@3196 = ~I might let you go if you answer a few questions for me. Where can I find your master, the sorcerer known as Ymmyrt?~
@3197 = ~Y-you wouldn't hurt a poor chef w-would you? I-it's bad luck, yes? Would you care for some sweets, <SIRMAAM>?~
@3198 = ~Do not worry, my good man. I'm not here to hurt you.~
@3199 = ~You'll have to serve me better than that in order to save your hide. I have some questions that need answering.~
@3200 = ~I'm willing to take the risk! You won't be cleaving meat for that sorcerer anymore!~
@3201 = ~Thank you, <SIRMAAM>. The very moment I saw you, I knew you were the honourable type. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll just take my leave and bother you no longer.~
@3202 = ~Hold on for a moment. I have a few questions that I would like you to answer.~
@3203 = ~Yes, get of my sight. And be quick with it, before I change my mind.~
@3204 = ~You're not going anywhere. In fact, I think I'd better make sure that you're not going anywhere. Ever.~
@3205 = ~Huh? And what would those questions be? I'm just the chef! I do my work and that's it. I doubt that I'd know anything that would be of use to a mighty adventurer such as yourself.~
@3206 = ~I will be judge of that. I would like you to tell me about Ymmyrt.~
@3207 = ~Stop playing games. Spit out everything you know about Ymmyrt.~
@3208 = ~Perhaps you're right. Now get out of here.~
@3209 = ~The master? Well, he eats mostly fresh fruits and white bread accompanied by red wine - honestly, I don't know how a man can live on such a diet. He has a passion for Calimshite sweets, too. Luckily the ingredients are rather easy to find and I-~
@3210 = ~How do you deliver his meals?~
@3211 = ~I see. You don't know anything about him besides his culinary preferences?~
@3212 = ~I'm not interested in his diet, you idiotic lout. Now tell me something useful.~
@3213 = ~You were right. Now get out of here before I lose my temper.~
@3214 = ~Now, look <SIRMAAM>, as I said, I'm a chef and I only concentrate on taking good care of my tasks here in the kitchen. It's not my business to stick my nose into his affairs.~
@3215 = ~All right, I believe you. Now you should probably leave.~
@3216 = ~No, I don't believe you and since you're not being co-operative, I'll just have to make sure that you don't run to tell tales to your master. Draw steel chef!~
@3217 = ~He eats real regular, real clockwork-like, so I just leave the prepared tray on that table there just before six in the morning, just before noon and just before five in the evening. That's when he eats his meals, you know. An imp always appears bang on time to pick up the tray and take it to him. How he gets to Ymmyrt's apartment, I have no idea. I only know that I can't go up the stairs in the hall.~
@3218 = ~Hmm... No help there. Thank you in any case, my good man. You are free to go.~
@3219 = ~Hmph, not much help there. Get out of my sight, you useless maggot.~
@3220 = ~Thank you for that useless information. Now I'll just have to make sure you'll not run off warning your master.~
@3221 = ~I'm going, I'm going! Please don't hurt me!~
@3222 = ~Please <SIRMAAM>, have mercy! I'm just a simple serving girl!~
@3223 = ~Don't worry girl, I'm not here to hurt you.~
@3224 = ~Stop that screaming, wench, or I might lose my temper!~
@3225 = ~You will not get any pity from me! Prepare to die, you maggot of Ymmyrt!~
@3226 = ~C-Can I go then? Please <SIRMAAM>, let me go!~
@3227 = ~Yes, run along, girl. There is nothing further I wish from you.~
@3228 = ~You may go, but I need you to answer a few questions first.~
@3229 = ~No, think I have changed my mind. Prepare to die, you maggot of Ymmyrt!~
@3230 = ~But I know nothing! I... I was recruited just last week, by the chef. Please <SIRMAAM>, I just try to earn money to support my baby boy. I have done nothing wrong. Please let me go!~
@3231 = ~All right, perhaps there is not much point in questioning you. Just run along now.~
@3232 = ~All right, perhaps there is not much point in questioning you. Here, take these coins and run along.~
@3233 = ~No, I think I have changed my mind. Prepare to die, you maggot of Ymmyrt!~
@3234 = ~Thank you! Thank you, <SIRMAAM>!~
@3235 = ~(The girl just stares at you, her green eyes wide and full of terror.)~
@3236 = ~That's better. Now if you could answer few questions for me.~
@3237 = ~I'm sorry. It was not my intention to scare you, girl. You are free to go now.~
@3238 = ~Ah, Lorraine, our game begins again... Wait! You're not her! No matter, you're not the master either and I have no obligation to spare your life. What a refreshing change.~ [M#DEM001]
@3239 = ~Atchooo...!~ [m#gabr01]
@3240 = ~(Coughs) Hrm... And who might you be stomping here with your muddy boots and dusty cloaks? Master won't be happy if you spoil his collection with all that dirt. Nooo, he sure won't.~ [m#gabr02]
@3241 = ~(The imp hops closer and begins to dust your cloak with a feather duster.)~
@3242 = ~I'm looking for the sorcerer Ymmyrt. I take you mean him when refer to the 'master'.~
@3243 = ~That's none of your business, imp. And get away from me with that duster.~
@3244 = ~Another simple beast? That duster wont serve you long in battle!~
@3245 = ~(The imp moves away from you and continues his task of arranging and dusting the books of the library. He seems to have completely forgotten your presence.)~
@3246 = ~Yes, Master, he is very wise, he is. He knows loads of stuff about everything, about imps and men and demons; many things, yes. (The imp continues to clean your gear.) Many wonderful thing he has collected, pretty and even prettier.~ [m#gabr03]
@3247 = ~But I don't know about that unicorn thing - horsies are kinda smelly... and hair, yes, have lotsa hair they do, too... would mess this place up something awful, they would.~ [m#gabr04]
@3248 = ~(Let the imp continue it's babbling.)~
@3249 = ~Whatever... Where can I find this master of yours?~
@3250 = ~I've had enough of your babbling, imp! Prepare to die!~
@3251 = ~And they leave droppings everywhere, too - not very nice. But if a unicorn is what the Master wants, a unicorn he must have. Does he ask poor me if it will be too much work? (The Imp ceases it's work and crosses its tiny arms, huffing indignantly.) No! No he does not. But Master knows best, yes. (The imp pulls a cleaning rag out of nowhere and begins to polish your boots.) It does not matter, no sir, never does.~
@3252 = ~That's why he got that woman, that pointy eared dark hair...~
@3253 = ~Master is wise and knows that dark hair's goddess is Lady of the Forest. And unicorns and forests go together, since horsies eat green things. But the dark hair is stubborn and wont give master a horsie. No she won't. Silly girl. There was loads of yelling and throwing of things - books too. Grrrr.... bad to throw books - books get all dirty and ragged. (The imp begins to scrub your boots more furiously.)~ [m#gabr06]
@3254 = ~But Master knows how to punish book throwers, oooooh yes, he does.~ [m#gabr07]
@3255 = ~Master makes the silly dark hair do things, horrible things, to nice, goody-two-shoe people. Hah-hih-hih... (The imp stops cleaning your boots, which are already shining anyway, and begins to giggle mischievously, rubbing its little hands together evilly.)~ [m#gabr08]
@3256 = ~All right, this is all very interesting, but where can I find this master of yours?~
@3257 = ~The Master would be working at this hour, down in his fancy laboratory. But I doubt that he would have anything to do with the likes of you. He is very wise and important you know. And busy. Yes, busy and wise.~ [m#gabr09]
@3258 = ~We'll see about that. Now, you should get back to cleaning the library.~
@3259 = ~He'll have everything to do with me should I wish so. Now get lost, imp.~
@3260 = ~Master, is that you? No? Well, perhaps you will stay with us until the master comes back to satisfy our needs.~
@3261 = ~Yessss, please stay. We need you, pretty one.~
@3262 = ~We're so lonely here. Would you not comfort us?~
@3263 = ~Ah Lorraine, you return. Have you completed the task I set you to? What? Who are these strangers? Is this one of your silly attempts to rebel? I warn you woman! Think of your little brat. You would not want anything bad to happen to him, would you?~ [M#YMM014]
@3264 = ~You foolish woman! Do you really believe that you or this rabble can harm me? The mightiest of sorcerers and master of arcane secrets? You are mad to think so!~ [M#YMM015]
@3265 = ~What? Who are you? What do you think you are doing storming into my laboratory like this, you insolent lout? I'll have that woman whipped for letting you slip past her.~ [M#YMM016]
@3266 = ~I came for my friend that you have unjustly taken captive. Return Amber to me and you may live!~
@3267 = ~Your servants cannot stop me, and neither can you. Prepare to die, wizard!~
@3268 = ~You won't have to whip her; I already disposed of your little servant. And you will be next.~
@3269 = ~You fool! Do you really believe that you could harm me? The mightiest of sorcerers and master of arcane secrets? You are mad to think so!~ [M#YMM017]
@3270 = ~Mother, Mother you did it! You saved me from that evil man.~ [m#gbo001]
@3271 = ~Oh Mother, don't cry. Everything is all right now. I'm not afraid, not any more.~ [m#gbo002]
@3272 = ~G-Good bye Mother. I'll say hi to Grandpa for you. We will be waiting for you, but you must promise me to try and live a happy life first.~ [m#gbo003]
@3273 = ~Who... Who are you? Where is Mother? I thought for sure that she would save me.~ [m#gbo004]
@3274 = ~Nevertheless, thank you for freeing me, whoever you are. Now I'll be able to find my mother and tell her I am finally free.~ [m#gbo005]
@3275 = ~She has gone before me, hasn't she?~ [m#gbo006]
@3276 = ~You will be waiting for me, Mother, won't you? I'm so glad that we can be together again, though you should have deserved a happier life. A long happy life - that is what I would give you if I was granted a wish.~ [m#gbo007]
@3277 = ~And you murdered her? You vile man! Vile and evil! I hope that you will fall in the hands of your own friends!~ [m#gbo008]
@3278 = ~And you murdered her? You vile woman! Vile and evil! I hope that you will fall in the hands of your own friends!~ [m#gbo009]
@3279 = ~I'm sorry, <SIRMAAM>. I'm still working on your previous order and I'm afraid I cannot take new ones before it has been finished.~
@3280 = ~Come back at the time we agreed upon and I'll have your item ready for you.~
@3281 = ~There you are, good <SIRMAAM>, welcome back. I've got your finished order right here - I trust you will find it more than satisfactory.~
@3282 = ~A good day to you, <LADYLORD>! My name is Rashryn, at your service. Would you be interested in some of the fine fabrics I have on sale? Or perhaps my quality furs and leathers would suit your needs better? Made to suit you both in cut and style, of course.~
@3283 = ~No, I am not interested in your wares. Perhaps later.~
@3284 = ~Well, I do have this nice hide that came off an exotic cat of some kind. Perhaps you could turn it into something useful for me.~
@3285 = ~I came across this piece of strong leather that I believe used to be the hide of a wyvern. I was wondering if you could make something useful out of it?~
@3286 = ~Another good day to you, my <LADYLORD>! A pleasure to see you again. Would you be interested in some of the fine fabrics I have on sale? Or perhaps my quality furs and leathers would suit your needs better? Made to suit you both in cut and style, of course.~
@3287 = ~In that case I will look forward to seeing you later, good <SIRMAAM>.~
@3288 = ~I rarely agree to work with anything that isn't produced by my own tanners. Most of the time the quality just doesn't meet the standards my customers are used to. But I can certainly take a look at that hide of yours.~
@3289 = ~Oh my...~
@3290 = ~I... I don't think that I've ever seen the work of a tanner that skilled. This fur must have come from somewhere far away. Not only is the animal itself exotic, but there is no tanner in Amn who can make the skin this soft while keeping the fur so thick and luxurious.~
@3291 = ~I'm glad that you have come to my shop with this piece of beauty, <SIRMAAM>. I shudder to think what would have happened had such an exquisite piece of material ended up in the hands of someone less skilled. I rarely pick up the needle and thread myself anymore, but I'm afraid this would be too precious a piece even for my skilled apprentices. I can assure you that you have just contracted the best tailor in the whole of Athkatla to work on your hide.~
@3292 = ~If you allow me to make a suggestion, good <SIRMAAM>, I would propose to make this magnificent hide into an equally magnificent cloak. It would be a shame to mar such a fur with excessive cuts and seams. For a mere 1000 gold pieces you would have a cloak suitable for any king or queen.~
@3293 = ~No, I'm not interested. Perhaps some other time?~
@3294 = ~I don't think I can afford that much gold. Perhaps we can negotiate on the price?~
@3295 = ~Sounds promising. I'll take your offer.~
@3296 = ~I'm afraid that won't be possible. This piece of fur deserves nothing but the best, and such skill does have its fair price.~
@3297 = ~Well, in that case I'm not interested. Perhaps some other time?~
@3298 = ~All right, then. I'll take your offer.~
@3299 = ~An excellent decision, <SIRMAAM>. I'll have the cloak ready for you this same time tomorrow.~
@3300 = ~Yes, how could I forget? You do not see quality like that every day. My offer still stands: for a 1000 gold pieces I will make you a cloak so fine that you will never want to wear another.~
@3301 = ~The hide of a wyvern, you say? I'm afraid that's not really my speciality, but I'm certainly willing to take on the challenge. At least I can safely assure you that there is no-one in Athkatla that would be more qualified for the task than I am.~
@3302 = ~Let me take a look at that... Yes, there certainly would be enough to make an exquisite robe for you. The work will be somewhat dangerous, though, wyverns being such poisonous creatures. I will have to charge a little extra for that.~
@3303 = ~But because I like you my friend, I'll throw in a little enchantment for you. For no extra charge, of course. You have an adventurous look about you <SIRMAAM>, and I'm sure you'll find my spell most useful in a tight spot.~
@3304 = ~Give me two full days and 3000 gold pieces, and you'll have yourself a robe of wyvern leather. Add a couple, say ten, emeralds to that, and I can make the enchantment even more potent.~
@3305 = ~Sounds promising. I'll take your offer. Leave out the emeralds, though.~
@3306 = ~I have the money but not the stones. I guess I'll just have to do without that extra enchantment.~
@3307 = ~Sounds good. I have the money and the emeralds right here.~
@3308 = ~I don't carry that many jewels on my person. I will be back later.~
@3309 = ~I'm afraid that won't be possible. As I said, the work does have its hazards and I'm not willing to take chances with my health. Proper precautions do take their time and require some rather expensive equipment, you see.~
@3310 = ~As you wish, <SIRMAAM>. Like I promised, I'll have the robe ready for you in two days.~
@3311 = ~Excellent choice, <SIRMAAM>. Like I promised, I'll have the robe ready for you in two days.~
@3312 = ~Yes, I so remember you, <SIRMAAM>. Have you thought about my offer? You will not find another tailor capable or willing to work with wyvern hide for 3000 gold pieces in Athkatla.~
@3313 = ~My offer for the ten emeralds is still on. They would ensure a measure of extra protection, very useful for an adventurous type like you, <SIRMAAM>.~
@3314 = ~You slip open the key ring, careful not to make a sound...~
@3315 = ~You silently unclasp the strap of the Book of Rings and open it...~
@3316 = ~No matter how hard you look at the map, you have no idea where the winding route indicated by it starts from. You will need to identify a familiar place on the map in order to use it.~
@3317 = ~(Leave the map alone for now.)~
@3318 = ~As you examine the map, you find the alley from which the winding route seems to start.~
@3319 = ~(Follow the route.)~
@3320 = ~As you examine the map, it seems that the alley from which the winding route starts is located in the slums of Athkatla.~
@3321 = ~(The main part of the strange-looking machine seems to be a large tank filled with some kind of dark green substance. The tank is connected by several thick tubes and wires to a pedestal, on which there is a socket of some kind, apparently made for holding a roughly spherical item the size of a large egg. There are also several dials and gauges on the pedestal, as well as a large switch.)~
@3322 = ~(Place the green gem into the socket and flick the switch.)~
@3323 = ~(Place the soul gem of Lorraine's son into the socket and flick the switch.)~
@3324 = ~(Place the red gem into the socket and flick the switch.~

@3326 = ~(Place the black gem into the socket and flick the switch.)~
@3327 = ~(Place the black soul gem into the socket and flick the switch.)~
@3328 = ~(Place the white gem into the socket and flick the switch.)~
@3329 = ~(Place the white soul into the socket and flick the switch.)~
@3330 = ~(Leave the machine alone for now.)~
@3331 = ~(The machine begins to tremble and emit a low, vibrating hum as the green tank seems to come to life.)~
@3332 = ~(One of the second story windows overlooking the alley has been broken and a rope fashioned from bedsheets hangs down from it. If you wish, you could climb up to the window.)~
@3333 = ~(Climb up to the window.)~
@3334 = ~Leave the rope alone.~
@3335 = ~(You deftly climb up the rope and help your comrades do the same.)~
@3336 = ~(You try to climb up the rope, but when you are almost at the window, you slip and fall to the street.)~
@3337 = ~You got what you wanted, <SIRMAAM>. Move along.~
@3338 = ~You have no business here! Get lost or you'll regret it.~

@4000 = ~Oh my! W-why would anyone do something like this? All of a sudden she is just gone! This is awful!~
@4001 = ~<CHARNAME>, we must help Amber. I-I think she was taken by slavers - Uncle Quayle has warned me about them. We must find where they have taken Amber.~
@4002 = ~Maybe... maybe we should start looking for them here in the slums. Uncle Quayle always said that that's where all the trouble in this city starts.~
@4003 = ~Maybe... maybe we should start looking for them in the slums. Uncle Quayle always said that that's where all the trouble in this city starts.~
@4004 = ~Maybe... maybe we should ask the head of this town for help.~
@4005 = ~I-I'm glad that we're helping her. Poor thing, I understand how she must feel about people treating her like a fr-freak.~
@4006 = ~I-I would like to help her and I understand how she must feel about people treating her like a fr-freak. But don't you think that she would put us all into danger with her presence?~
@4007 = ~I-I think you should be more thankful. <CHARNAME> risked a lot to save you and you have repaid <PRO_HIMHER> with nothing but disregard. T-That is so very rude.~
@4008 = ~Maybe you should start thinking before acting and try to be less rude. Then you would not have to come and apologise afterwards.~
@4009 = ~Oh... I-I am so sorry, <CHARNAME>. I did not mean to... interrupt.~
@4010 = ~Oh... I-I am so sorry, <PLAYER2>. I did not mean to... interrupt.~
@4011 = ~Good heavens, <CHARNAME>, you really are hurt!~
@4012 = ~J-just hold on a moment now... just keep still and let me take care of those wounds there...~
@4013 = ~I-I am afraid I am too weak to help you now... Just hold on, <CHARNAME>, we will not let you go.~
@4014 = ~Perhaps <PLAYER2> could help?~
@4015 = ~Good heavens, <PLAYER2>, you really are hurt!~
@4016 = ~I-I am afraid I am too weak to help you now... Just hold on, <PLAYER2>, we will not let you go.~
@4017 = ~Perhaps <CHARNAME> could help?~
@4018 = ~Aeeeeei! <CHARNAME>! What are you doing here? (Blushing, Aerie runs for a blanket and hastily covers her slender body with it.) W-Why did you sneak up on me like that? Have you no shame?~
@4019 = ~(Step out of the shadows to the moonlight.)  Ehhh.... I am sorry Aerie. I fancied a bath and I did not realise that you did too. But if you are finished - do you mind if I take my bath now?~
@4020 = ~Umm... excuse me... I think that I should go now. (Go back to the camp.)~
@4021 = ~(Go back to the camp, really fast.)~
@4022 = ~(Aerie's blue eyes widen in shock as you come closer.) How dare you? Leave me alone! (Aerie starts sobbing and runs away from you.)~
@4023 = ~Aeeeeei! <CHARNAME>! What are you doing here? (Blushing, Aerie runs for a blanket and hastily covers her slender body with it.) W-Why did you sneak on me like that? Have you no shame?~
@4024 = ~(Aerie's blue eyes widen in shock as you come closer) How dare you? Leave me alone! (Aerie starts sobbing and runs away from you.)~
@4025 = ~What arrogance! That witch of a woman has some guts to sneak upon us and leave her henchmen to do her dirty work while sweeping away with her prize like a petty thief. I might not fully agree with your decision to keep Amber's company, but an insult like this should not be overlooked.~
@4026 = ~The slavers of Athkatla, that the Order has fought to destroy, are known to deal with exotic merchandise... You are likely to find these slavers among their kinsmen: robbers, snitches and other lowlife scum.~
@4027 = ~You are not planning to take this thing with us, are you? I don't know what it is, but it is an abomination of natural laws, of that I am sure.~
@4028 = ~<CHARNAME>! Have you no decency?~
@4029 = ~<PLAYER2>! Have you no decency?~
@4030 = ~What is the matter with you, girl? I guess that your demonic parents never taught you how to talk to your superiors.~
@4031 = ~Were it your life at stake, I would give you a lesson in manners, you impudent whelp. But since it is our leader who is in peril, I will lend my powers despite your feeble provocations.~
@4032 = ~Save your breath, girl. I currently have no means to help him, but I am sure <CHARNAME> will be just fine even without my help. Stop being hysterical.~
@4033 = ~Were it your life at stake, I would give you a lesson in manners, you impudent whelp. But since it is our leader who is in peril, I will lend my powers despite of your feeble provocations.~

@4035 = ~Calm down, Amber. I'll see what I can do to help him.~
@4036 = ~Ah, things are not as grave as they first seemed... My spell should give him enough strength to begin his recovery.~
@4037 = ~Unfortunately I can do naught for him right now. My skills will do little for his wounds since I have no spells to reinforce them with.~
@4038 = ~How embarrassing (<CHARNAME> should brush up on <PRO_HISHER> leadership skills). Those simians ambushed us all too easily -we should seek revenge or we'll be the laughing stock of every thug in this city.~
@4039 = ~Even a fool could see that those cretins who attacked us were slavers. I happen to know (because unlike you, I have connections) that they have a hideout in the slums of Athkatla.~
@4040 = ~Ah, I saw this coming long ago. I knew you two could not resist your animal instincts.~
@4041 = ~Oh, woe is me! A cruel turn of fate has stolen our fiery angel from us. But despair not, my raven - these men bore the air of slavers upon them as clearly as if a mark was burned upon their flesh.~
@4042 = ~All that is left is only the simple matter of locating their lair, which surely cannot be very far from the habitat of other lowlife.~
@4043 = ~This sleepy town is unlikely to harbour such vicious villains, my raven. We are much likely to find their lair in the buzzing capital, close to the habitat of other lowlife.~
@4044 = ~I'll be most pleased for the company of this delicate hummingbird. She has a fiery spirit that will surely kindle flames in this poet's heart.~
@4045 = ~But my dear hummingbird! Cannot you see that only because of our ancestors can we truly succumb to entropy and embrace the chaos. This sparrow draws strength and inspiration- ~
@4046 = ~Ah, my hummingbird, you should accompany this bard on his travels some time. The planes hold many wondrous, secret places, and if savage beauty lights your heart my angel... This sparrow dares to believe that he could show something that you might take a liking to.~
@4047 = ~Ah, my raven, I envy you. A beautiful night, a lady even more fair, and a passion burning in one's soul. Even the skies celebrate this event. I would write it into a song, but alas, my poor heart is aching to be the hero in that tale. But that is not to be, is it, my hummingbird?~
@4048 = ~Ah, my hawk, I envy you. A beautiful night, a lady even more fair, and a passion burning in one's soul. Even the skies celebrate this event. I would write it into a song, but alas, my poor heart is aching to be the hero in that tale. But that is not to be, is it, my hummingbird?~
@4049 = ~Ah, my mockingbird, I envy you. A beautiful night, a lady even more fair, and a passion burning in one's soul. Even the skies celebrate this event. I would write it into a song, but alas, my poor heart is aching to be the hero in that tale. But that is not to be, is it, my hummingbird?~
@4050 = ~Ah, my owl, I envy you. A beautiful night, a lady even more fair, and a passion burning in one's soul. Even the skies celebrate this event. I would write it into a song, but alas, my poor heart is aching to be the hero in that tale. But that is not to be, is it, my hummingbird?~
@4051 = ~Ah, my ibis, I envy you. A beautiful night, a lady even more fair, and a passion burning in one's soul. Even the skies celebrate this event. I would write it into a song, but alas, my poor heart is aching to be the hero in that tale. But that is not to be, is it, my hummingbird?~
@4052 = ~Ah, my hound, I envy you. A beautiful night, a lady even more fair, and a passion burning in one's soul. Even the skies celebrate this event. I would write it into a song, but alas, my poor heart is aching to be the hero in that tale. But that is not to be, is it, my hummingbird?~
@4053 = ~Heya, you said your name was Amber, right? Well, that suits you really well you know; that's probably most intensive red hair I've ever seen. It's very pretty. My name is Imoen, by the way.~
@4054 = ~Heya Amber! It's time for me to take up the watch... Oooops! Eh - sorry guys, I did not mean to interrupt you or anything. But since I already spoiled the moment, I can point out that that is probably not the most efficient way to keep guard.~
@4055 = ~By Silvanus! How could we let those slavers sneak up on us like that? This is inexcusable - we must track them down and punish them for their vile deeds. The very idea of slavery is an affront to nature and should never be tolerated.~
@4056 = ~Remember that scum attracts more scum - we should start our search in the shadiest part of the city.~
@4057 = ~The local authorities must be notified of this. We should speak with the High Merchant; he knows local problems better than us and might be able to give us a clue where to go looking for them.~
@4058 = ~This creature is not of this world. I suggest that you think carefully before making any rash decisions about her, <CHARNAME>.~
@4059 = ~Not now, Amber. Can you not see that <CHARNAME> is busy?~
@4060 = ~You sarcasm has very little effect on me, so you should just save it for someone who cares. Now, fall back in line.~
@4061 = ~What do you think you are doing, you two? Amber, do you not realise that you are putting all of us in grave danger by neglecting your guard duty? And <CHARNAME>, I would have thought that at least you would understand this. I am very disappointed in you both.~
@4062 = ~What do you think you are doing, you two? Amber, do you not realise that you are putting all of us in grave danger by neglecting your guard duty? And <PLAYER2>, I would have thought that at least you would understand this. I am very disappointed in you both.~
@4063 = ~Patience is one of the benefits conferred by experience, Amber. Move aside, I cannot do a thing with you hovering around <CHARNAME> like that.~
@4064 = ~Hmmm... His wounds are serious indeed, but I can assure you that he won't be leaving our company just yet.~
@4065 = ~There is not much I can do, since I already spent all my powers in battle. Now I can only pray to the Oak Father that <CHARNAME> will remain with us for a while longer.~
@4066 = ~Patience is one of the benefits conferred by experience, Amber. Move aside, I cannot do a thing with you hovering around <PLAYER2> like that.~
@4067 = ~There is not much I can do, since I already spent all my powers in battle. Now I can only pray to the Oak Father that <PLAYER2> will remain with us for a while longer.~
@4068 = ~Amber, a moment of your time, if you please. ~
@4069 = ~I see that you are getting close with <CHARNAME>, but you should bear in mind that he is still very young and inexperienced in many ways. Although your face does not betray your age, I suspect you are his senior by far and thus should be careful with him.~
@4070 = ~I only try to do what I think is best, and you try to turn it into a quarrel between us? You should think twice before calling me a hypocrite.~
@4071 = ~Did you see that? They just grabbed her like a sack of turnips! How rude!~
@4072 = ~Something like that once happened to old Harry Turwocket, my third cousin on my mother's side - and a great cook, incidentally - or so we thought. In the end it turned out that he had just taken a wrong turn coming from the market and ended up on the wrong side of the city walls.~
@4073 = ~But I doubt that is the case here. I'm afraid someone has taken an unwelcome interest in our fiery friend. But I really cannot begin to fathom who would that be - those ruffians looked no different from the malingerers that constantly hang around our neighbourhood.~
@4074 = ~Heh. Young love... You two remind me of my - please interrupt me if have told this before...~
@4075 = ~Slavers are like a pestilence to our fair city, infesting the most wretched parts of Athkatla. Every time the Order has tried to eradicate the epidemic once and for all, it turns out that we have only managed to stall its progress for a while. Judging by this, there seems to be no permanent cure in sight.~
@4076 = ~I see that slavers are a problem here just as they are in Athkatla. We should see the High Merchant Logan Coprinth in order to learn what measures this town has taken against them, and if anything is known of their base of operations.~
@4077 = ~I wager that the guards had sufficient reason to detain her. It would be best to leave her to face justice; if she is innocent, she will regain her freedom in due course.~
@4078 = ~I sense no true evil in this woman, and she bears the symbol of Mielikki, the Lady of the Forest. We should hear her out. I cannot see why a servant of Mielikki would attack us.~
@4079 = ~Noble lady, I will do all that is in my power to help your son. Also, you need not fear any additional harm to your person from this party. I will see that your wounds get proper attention. They are severe, and I am amazed that you are able to speak at all.~
@4080 = ~What a stroke of luck has hit ye, <CHARNAME>. That irksome lass is not yer concern any longer.~
@4081 = ~But I'd reckon there's now some unfinished business between the slavers, ye and meself. Mostly of the owe-us-some-gold kind. If ye want the goods, ye got ta pay for 'em, too.~
@4082 = ~What say ye then? I say we drag our asses to the slaver hideout in the slums and have a little heart to heart with those stealing scumbags.~
@4083 = ~Ptyih... Must ye drag every stray dog with ye <CHARNAME>? Girlie that skinny won't ever pull 'er weight.  ~
@4084 = ~Yich! Yer disgusting, you filthy rabbits! Just get outta me sight or I'll be sure to hurl me innards.~
@4085 = ~AAAAARGH!~
@4086 = ~By Arvoreen! This not something we can overlook. A friend and a companion taken from us within a heartbeat.~
@4087 = ~I've dealt with the likes of these fellows before. Their manners and outfits suggest that they are slavers. We'd best look for them where other petty thieves and lowlife criminals make their home.~
@4088 = ~I've dealt with the likes of these fellows before. Their manners and outfits suggest that they are slavers. I'm deeply saddened that they have infested this fair city. We should talk to Lord Logan immediately.~
@4089 = ~I respect your decision, <CHARNAME>, and trust that you would not take her with us were it not for the best.~
@4090 = ~Stay your hand, <CHARNAME>. Mercy is a virtue honourable people bestow even upon the vilest of their enemies. Let her speak.~
@4091 = ~My lady, you fought with honour and dignity. We will help you shed this burden that compels you to acts of evil. Please, accept my deepest condolences for the death of your son.~
@4092 = ~Milord! I am speechless! How could you distract Amber from her guard duty? That was very irresponsible of you.~
@4093 = ~Arrgh! Boo is roaring with fury! And Minsc agrees with him. This is an outrage!~
@4094 = ~We must help Amber at once. Boo says all sort of evil people live in this very part of the city. We must raid every house at once!~
@4095 = ~We must help Amber at once. Boo says all sort of evil people live in the slums of Athkatla. We must travel there at once!~
@4096 = ~Oooo... Boo thinks that you're cute, <CHARNAME>. But Minsc cannot see how you are going to kick evil in the backside while doing that.~
@4097 = ~Oooo... Boo thinks that you're cute, <PLAYER2>. But Minsc cannot see how you are going to kick evil in the backside while doing that.~
@4098 = ~Whew! That bought back some unpleasant memories. This time I think the people responsible are not from high society, though.~
@4099 = ~Could it be that these people were slavers, <CHARNAME>? What do you think?~
@4100 = ~Yes, I think you might be right.~
@4101 = ~Hmmm... I'm not so sure about that.~
@4102 = ~Whew! I really dislike surprises like that.~
@4103 = ~There are always suspicious folk hanging around the Copper Coronet. I think I've seen one or two of the fellows that attacked us there.~
@4104 = ~Hey, get a room you two! Or at least go somewhere else now that your shift is over.~
@4105 = ~What a display of cowardice from that witch woman! It is embarrassing how easily those slavers snatched their prey from right under our noses.~
@4106 = ~When I was still in the military, our men raided several slaver hideouts in the slums. I suspect that it would still be the best place to start looking.~
@4107 = ~I think we should inform Lord Logan of this crime. If it was the doing of local lowlife, he might know something.~
@4108 = ~Eeer... Do you wish me to come back later, <CHARNAME>?~
@4109 = ~Eeer... Do you wish me to come back later, <PLAYER2>?~
@4110 = ~W-what? Oh, <CHARNAME>, you certainly caught me off guard. But feel free to take your bath after me if you wish. I'll leave the rest of the soapwort here on the rock for you.~
@4111 = ~<CHARNAME>! I thought you were a bandit looking for easy prey - I could easily have skewered you right there, but luckily I felt curious as to who would be following us. What are you doing here, sneaking around like that?~
@4112 = ~Um, I just felt that I needed a bath and came here. When I found the pond already occupied, I thought I should not disturb you and tried to leave, but my foot caught on a root and I fell.~
@4113 = ~Um, nothing, really. I was just taking a walk and happened to wander this way. I didn't even notice you. I am sorry if I disturbed you.~
@4114 = ~(Valygar lets go of your shirt.) Oh, I'm sorry. I should have probably told you that I was going to take a bath, and we could have taken our turns in washing up. Would have saved us from this rather embarrassing encounter.~
@4115 = ~Now, if you don't mind, I should probably finish washing myself. Feel free to use the pond after I'm done. I'll leave the rest of the soapwort there on the rock for you.~
@4116 = ~Um, thank you for the offer, but I guess that I'll just go back to the camp and go to sleep. You just take your time. (Leave.) ~
@4117 = ~Oh, right, thank you. I'll just go back to the camp, then. Just let me know when you are done. (Leave.)~
@4118 = ~(Valygar gives you an odd look as he lets go of your shirt.) Hmh. You should be more careful when walking around at night. I might have been a bandit waiting in ambush for you, in which case you would already be dead. Now, if you don't mind, I would like to finish washing myself.~
@4119 = ~Um. Of course. I'll just be going now. (Leave.)~
@4120 = ~(Valygar gives you an odd look as you turn to leave but says nothing.)~
@4121 = ~Ah, I can see that you rivvin are not above slavery, after all. And unlike among my kindred, your merchants have to hide in the bowels of your cities amidst all the rats and filth - that simply cannot be good for their merchandise.~
@4122 = ~In this case there is not much to be spoiled, though... I would suggest that we move on and be grateful for this incident which so conveniently removed that tiresome pest from our presence.~
@4123 = ~You plan to take this pathetic creature with you, <CHARNAME>? Of what use could she ever be to you?~
@4124 = ~And what makes you think that <CHARNAME> or anyone else here would be interested in that, fiendling? Save yourself the trouble and spare us from hearing every dull detail of your life. ~
@4125 = ~You are in no position to tell me what to do or not to do, pest.~
@4126 = ~Your concern for my well-being is *so* touching, little fiend.~
@4127 = ~My, my - a fiendish mongrel like yourself calling others repulsive and obnoxious. You do rather well in that department yourself.~
@4128 = ~That's enough, both of you! Now get back in line and let's move on before this gets out of control.~
@4129 = ~Not so concerned over the drow, are you now, Amber? Admit it, you would be more than glad to see this particular drow dead.~
@4130 = ~That was totally unnecessary, Viconia. Amber is right; you could have got yourself killed back there with all those elves running amok.~
@4131 = ~And I did express my gratitude for her concern, after which she blew up in my face. Unpleasant, but not entirely unexpected.~
@4132 = ~That's enough! We should get going before <CHARNAME> loses <PRO_HISHER> temper.~
@4133 = ~Spoiled something sweet here, did I? How insensitive of me.~
@4134 = ~I will not take orders from you, little tiefling.~
@4135 = ~If you wish me to help your dear <CHARNAME>, you would do well to adopt a different tone of voice.~
@4136 = ~No need to worry, tiefling. I will heal him, but do not think for a second that I am doing it for you.~
@4137 = ~There is nothing I can do for him right now, and even if there was, your tone of voice might just persuade me *not* to help him.~
@4138 = ~If you wish me to help your dear <PLAYER2>, you would do well to adopt a different tone of voice.~
@4139 = ~Great, jaluk. Go ahead and turn this nonsense into a sobfest. Just get a grip on yourselves, both of you.~
@4140 = ~All right, <CHARNAME>. You can come out of the bushes now.~
@4141 = ~(Run back to the camp as fast as you can.)~
@4142 = ~I can see through the pathetic game you're playing, little vixen, and I suggest that you stop.~
@4143 = ~Dos ph' natha wael ka dos gyolaen uns'aa.~
@4144 = ~Don't play a fool, you're smarter than that. I have seen the longing looks you cast towards <CHARNAME>. I have marked this male as my own. You would do well to tear your lustful eyes away from my property.~
@4145 = ~Not so fast, little vixen. I'm not finished with you yet.~
@4146 = ~Very well, jaluk. I shall not tease your little beast any further, but neither shall I tease you any more. And I can assure you that is something you will come to regret.~
@4147 = ~Now there is an idea worth considering. A vaen il telanthen l' aster.~
@4148 = ~Hah! You're not man enough to polish my boots, <CHARNAME>.~
@4149 = ~Don't you pretend to know anything about me, you worthless maggot.~
@4150 = ~Ah, I see. The little fiendling is afraid of the glorious secrets of the Underdark. Taking it out on me is not going to help you, however. It is not my fault that you are too weak for this place.~
@4151 = ~You are a fool, <CHARNAME>, if you presume to sneak in here without anyone noticing. One squealing little tiefling makes no difference. Our presence is already well known to anyone who cares.~
@4152 = ~When we encounter my kin it is totally irrelevant whether I accompany you or not. The drow do not suffer surfacers to walk in these caverns - they will kill us on sight. Or, if you're unlucky enough to survive, you'll live to serve them as slaves.~
@4153 = ~When they find out who you really are, it is totally irrelevant whether I accompany you or not. The drow do not suffer surfacers to walk in these caverns - they will kill us on sight. Or, if you're unlucky enough to survive, you'll live to serve them as slaves.~
@4154 = ~Dos ph' natha uln'hyrr.~
@4155 = ~That is a lie and you know it.~
@4156 = ~That was an embarrassing surprise if I have ever seen one.~
@4157 = ~A bunch of mediocre slavers steals one of our party right from under our noses - they surely must have had an extra incentive to take such a risk. Which means this could turn out profitable for us, should we manage to track them down and find out who this wealthy patron of theirs is.~
@4158 = ~I know that the slums have been a hiding place of slavers for generations, and I see no reason why it should be otherwise in this case.~
@4159 = ~It's doubtful that we'll find her in this town. But I do know that the slums of Athkatla have been a hiding place of slavers for generations, and I see no reason why it should be otherwise in this case.~
@4160 = ~For all the commotion she has caused I would have expected something more... dangerous. There is definitely something about her that is not quite right, though.~
@4161 = ~It seems that spring is upon us - the sap is rising in the trees and the bees are busy with the flowers. Heh heh.~
@4162 = ~(After a hard day's march, you feel even more dirty and smelly than usual. You recall seeing a pond just a stone's throw away that might help remedy the situation.)~
@4163 = ~(Go to sleep, disregarding the stink of blood and sweat.)~
@4164 = ~(Go wash yourself in the refreshing pool of water, even though it's bound to be ice cold.) ~
@4165 = ~(Although you feel dead tired, you nevertheless decide to go for a quick swim in the small pond you saw earlier when you were looking for a campsite. While you approach the spot where you remember seeing the pond, you hear soft splashes of water that tell you somebody has already stolen your watering hole.)~
@4166 = ~(Turn around and go back to the camp.)~
@4167 = ~(Sneak closer to see who it is.)~
@4168 = ~(Listen.)~
@4169 = ~(Since you are not feeling too tired, you decide to go for a quick swim in the small pond you saw earlier when you were looking for a campsite. While you approach the spot where you remember seeing the pond, you hear soft splashes of water that tell you somebody has already stolen your watering hole.)~
@4170 = ~(You sneak through the bushes as quietly as the rustling branches allow. Stopping right before you step out of the shadows to the moonlit clearing, you suddenly find out who it was making all the splashing noises.)~
@4171 = ~(You see something you would never have believed you would have to see: a stark naked dwarf bathing. The once so clear pool is visibly murky from all the dirt Korgan has rubbed off from his thick skin.)~
@4172 = ~(You turn, perhaps too quickly because you realise you have just made your presence more than clear to the dwarf by stepping on a twig that makes an uncomfortably loud crack under your feet.)~
@4173 = ~(To your surprise, you see Korgan bathing in the pond. The once so clear pool is visibly murky from all the dirt Korgan has rubbed off from his thick skin. You cannot decide which upsets you more: the fact that Korgan is actually taking a bath, or the fact that his obvious lack of personal hygiene, as witnessed by the current state of the pond, so painfully highlights his being a disgrace to your noble - and generally cleanly - race.)~
@4174 = ~(As you are trying to decide upon the correct course of action for this situation, you realise that you have just made your presence more than clear to him by stepping on a twig that makes an uncomfortably loud crack under your feet.)~
@4175 = ~(You have probably never run so fast, but on the other hand, you have never had a such good reason. Korgan's anger eventually subsides, but he continues to throw nasty glares in your direction for several days.)~
@4176 = ~(You barely manage to realise that it is Aerie whose bath you have interrupted before she catches you with her infravision.)~
@4177 = ~(You see Viconia - all of her. The drow is standing sideways to you, knee deep in the water. Her hands are high above her head as she soaps her long white hair. At first you can only see her silhouette against the rippling darkness of the water, but suddenly the clouds break and the moonlight reflects softly from her ebony skin. You know you should leave, but you can only stand still, transfixed by the sight of her.)~
@4178 = ~(With great effort, tear your eyes off the drow and sneak back to the camp.)~
@4179 = ~(Do nothing.)~
@4180 = ~(The night is cool and you can see Viconia shiver in the chill air. Somehow the involuntary shivers make her seem vulnerable, creating a fascinating contrast to the otherwise tough nature of the drow. Suddenly you feel warm and while your every instinct practically screams for you to leave, your feet remain rooted to the ground.)~
@4181 = ~(Force your feet from the ground and sneak back to the camp.)~
@4182 = ~(Viconia slowly wades to the deeper end of the pond. She tilts her head backwards to wash the soap from her hair that looks like the brilliant silvery web of a spider floating on the surface of the dark water. Having rinsed her hair, she slowly but steadily walks back towards the shallow end of the pond, wringing water out of her silvery mane. As she steps out of the pond, small rivulets of water run down between her breasts to her belly and below.)~
@4183 = ~(Once on the shore, the drow turns straight towards you, boldly and uninhibitedly displaying her naked body, still glistening with water in the moonlight. You see her eyes gleam with a soft, crimson glow.)~
@4184 = ~(You are startled by a loud, resounding crack just as you reach the edge of the clearing. The crack is followed by several more in a rapid succession.)~
@4185 = ~(As soon as you recover from your surprise, you realise it is Valygar who is making the noise by hitting a stone the size of a fist against a larger, flat one sitting on the ground. Spread on the larger rock you see some roots that you think might be soapwort, which are rapidly turning into a mound of thick foam as Valygar continues to grind and beat them with the stone.)~
@4186 = ~(Leave Valygar alone, sneak back to the camp.)~
@4187 = ~Hey, Valygar! I'm sorry to disturb you, but I felt like I could use a bath. (Step out of the woods.)~
@4188 = ~(Do nothing, stay where you are.)~
@4189 = ~(You cannot help noticing that the tall ranger has already stripped half-naked, apparently to take the bath that you longed for, and to wash the dirt and bloodstains from his clothes. You cannot help admiring his well-proportioned body as his taut muscles work the pestle stone up and down again, the moonlight glistening on his darkly tanned skin. His shirt, still wet and dripping, is hanging from a nearby tree branch as Valygar prepares to remove the rest of his clothes.)~
@4190 = ~(Leave Valygar alone and sneak back to the camp.)~
@4191 = ~(Do nothing, stay where you are.) ~
@4192 = ~ (When you turn around to leave, a root snags your foot and despite your panicked attempts to regain your balance, you fall headlong into the rushes.)~
@4193 = ~(As you try to scramble back to your feet, you feel something hit you squarely between the shoulder blades and quickly find yourself pressed face-down against the ground. Something unpleasantly sharp presses firmly against the small of your back. A hand grabs you by your shirt and flips you over. You find yourself staring at Valygar's naked form holding the tip of a keen-edged sword in front of your face.)~
@4194 = ~(You stand mesmerised by the sight of the sleek ranger as he carefully removes the rest of his dirty clothes and carefully steps into the cold water. His muscles tense as he wades deeper and nimbly dives into the dark pool, disappearing under the calm surface with the slightest of splashes.)~
@4195 = ~(Leave and sneak back to the camp.)~
@4196 = ~(After looking at the empty and silent pond for what seems like an eternity, you begin to suspect having imagined the whole thing. Just as you blink your eyes as if to shake off the memory, Valygar suddenly emerges from the placid water, splashing water high into the air. As he steps out of the water, you suddenly realise that you are staring straight into his eyes.)~
@4197 = ~(Turn around and run for your life.)~
@4198 = ~Hey, Valygar! I'm sorry to disturb you, but I felt like I could use a bath.~
@4199 = ~(You walk back to the camp and wait for Valygar to return. After a while he strides back into the camp and discreetly nods at you. The water of the pond is just as freezing as you thought it might be, but the soapwort Valygar left you gets you feeling extra clean and fresh.)~
@4200 = ~(The bath is quite refreshing and the soapwort leaves you feeling extra clean and fresh afterwards.)~
@4201 = ~(You hear soft humming that after a while transforms to a murmuring song. You cannot quite make out the words, but you recognise the voice to be Amber's.)~
@4202 = ~(Go back to the camp.)~
@4203 = ~(Sneak closer.)~
@4204 = ~(Start humming the same tune.)~
@4205 = ~(As you carefully peek between the branches, your heart almost skips a beat. You see Amber standing waist-deep in the water, lathering her gorgeous red mane and humming a tune you do not remember ever hearing before.)~
@4206 = ~(You cannot help staring at the sight of her taut body as she slowly works the foam into her hair. Despite the feeling that you really should not be watching, your feet feel as if they had grown roots.)~
@4207 = ~(Step out of the bush and into the clearing.)~
@4208 = ~(Having worked the soap into her hair, Amber goes on to cover her whole body with the luxurious foam, enjoying its cleansing effect. As your eyes trace every line of her delicate shape, glistening with soap in the moonlight, you cannot help thinking that for tonight, the scent that is so inimitably her will be gone, replaced by the fresh smell of soapwort. You know you should leave, but you can only stand still, transfixed by the sight of her.)~
@4209 = ~(With great effort, tear your eyes off Amber and sneak back to the camp.)~
@4210 = ~(With one swift movement Amber dives into the depths of the pond, surfacing for air on the other side. Preserving her natural grace even in the water, she languidly swims back towards the shore, seeming to savour the cool touch of the water on her freshly washed body. As she stands up in the waist-deep water and wades towards the shore, little islands of foam float around her legs.)~
@4211 = ~(Sneak back to the camp.)~
@4212 = ~(Standing only ankle deep in the water, Amber lets her eyes routinely scan her surroundings, like a deer watching out for predators. As her eyes slide past the bush you are hiding in, she freezes. The soft red glow of her eyes disappears for a surprised blink of an eye, and you can almost feel her heart skip a beat.)~
@4213 = ~(As if acting upon pure instinct, she dashes for the sword propped against the rock on which her clothes lie.)~
@4214 = ~(You are distracted by the sight of her lithe yet unmistakably feminine body glistening in the moonlight, her muscles tense and primed for attack. You notice a slight shiver going through her body, but you cannot tell whether it is due to the cool air, the rush of adrenaline or something else altogether.)~
@4215 = ~Amber, it's all right. I just fancied a bath, but it seems that you had the same idea.~
@4216 = ~What was that tune you were humming? I don't think that I have ever heard it before.~
@4217 = ~Oh, I get the hint. I am sorry for having disturbed your bath.~
@4218 = ~Amber - it is cold here and you are shivering. Would you mind if I- ~
@4219 = ~(Within a heartbeat of you stepping out of the woods, Amber realises that she has been ambushed. As if acting upon pure instinct, she dashes for the sword propped against the rock on which her clothes lie.)~
@4220 = ~(Within two heartbeats of joining the song, Amber's voice ends abruptly and you hear rapid splashes as she quickly wades to the shore. The sound of a sword being pulled out of its sheath tells you that she is quite prepared to defend herself.)~
@4221 = ~Amber, it is all right. I just fancied a bath, but it seems that you had the same idea. (Make your way to the pond and  step out of the bushes.)~
@4222 = ~(Sneak away, back to the camp.)~
@4223 = ~(When you step out of the bush and raise your eyes to greet Amber, you are surprised to find her standing there stark naked, facing you with her blade drawn and pointed directly at your throat.)~
@4224 = ~(You are distracted by the sight of her lithe yet unmistakably feminine body glistening in the moonlight, her muscles taut and primed for attack. You notice a slight shiver going through her body, but you cannot tell whether it is due to the cool air, the rush of adrenaline or something else altogether.)~
@4225 = ~Whoa! You can put that blade away, it's just me. And besides, I don't think you'd need it anyway - most attackers would probably drop their weapons out of sheer surprise.~
@4226 = ~Amber - it is cold here and  you are shivering. Would you mind if I- ~

@4240 = ~Do I now have everything I need for you to seal this form for me?~
@4241 = ~Well, you would need the form filled out and signed first, my friend. The Civil Servants should be able to help you with that.~
@4242 = ~Ah, but you still need a stamp from a Civil Servant to verify that this event has been duly recorded in our files. The Civil Servant probably forgot that, but you have to be understanding. They're working under a great deal of stress.~
@4243 = ~Why, yes. Here, let me seal it for you. All right, now everything should be in order. Glad to be of assistance.~
@4244 = ~Do you not see that I am busy? State your business quickly and be gone with it.~
@4245 = ~I would like to have Form-~
@4246 = ~Never mind...~
@4247 = ~Move on then! You are blocking the line.~
@4248 = ~You can get forms from the clerk, go see him. Next!~
@4249 = ~Do you not see that I am busy? Go see the clerk.~
@4250 = ~If you came to inquire about that land ownership conflict, I suggest you go see the herald. I don't-~
@4251 = ~Actually, I just need this form filled out and signed.~
@4252 = ~Krhmm... Let me see... Yes, everything seems to be in order...  What do you need this form for?~
@4253 = ~Eh, why do you want to know?~
@4254 = ~Oh, I just want to have the demon in the prison released under my custody.~
@4255 = ~I cannot fill out this form unless you tell what it is for. Now, if you are here just to waste my time, please move aside so that I can get to serving customers with real business.~
@4256 = ~Well, I just wanted to take a look at the demon in the prison... If it's not too much trouble, you could just as well release it under my custody as well. I'm skilled in handling demons, you see.~
@4257 = ~I see... Well, you should have told the clerk that we're talking about a demon, because for one of those, you also need an Appendix B135 for dangerous creatures. Unless you get me that, I cannot help you.~
@4258 = ~You needed something?~
@4259 = ~I now have both Form 1567 and Appendix B135. Could you PLEASE fill them out and sign them?~
@4260 = ~Got up on the wrong side of the bed today, eh? You still should not vent your frustration on me, <SIRMAAM>. 'Tis a very taxing and ungrateful job being a civil servant, you know.~

@4262 = ~Just forget it, I just can't take this any more!~
@4263 = ~Some people just have *no* idea how to behave... Next!~

@4273 = ~The *forms*, filled and signed!~
@4274 = ~(sigh) I now have both Form 1567 and Appendix B135. Could you, PLEASE, fill them in and sign them?~
@4275 = ~Yes?~
@4276 = ~Could you perhaps give me Form 1567?~
@4277 = ~Could you perhaps give me another copy of Form 1567?~
@4278 = ~Yes, of course I could, but didn't your mother teach you to say 'please'? Apparently not. Here you go anyway. Remember to take it to the Civil Servant to be filled out and signed.~
@4279 = ~I'm afraid I gave you the last one. I suggest that you find the one I gave you - it might be a while before our scribes can make more of those.~
@4280 = ~How can I help you?~
@4281 = ~It turned out that I need Appendix B135 for this form... um... please.~
@4282 = ~Could I have another copy of Appendix B135, please.~
@4283 = ~Hmmm... You could have told me right away that you needed that one. That would have saved a lot of trouble for both of us, young <MANWOMAN>.~
@4284 = ~All right, here it is. That is the last copy - don't lose it. You wont be getting a new one before our scribes make some more.~
@4285 = ~I'm afraid that is impossible. As I already told you, I gave the last copy to you. I suggest you go and find it - we are quite low on most of the forms and appendices.~
@4286 = ~Hrmph...~
@4287 = ~I'm looking for a certain bracelet that was allegedly sold to you. Do you still have it?~
@4288 = ~I heard you've got something I might be interested in.~
@4289 = ~I have the money now. Do you still have the bracelet?~
@4290 = ~I still don't have enough money. Are you sure you couldn't go any lower on the price?~
@4291 = ~I would like to take a look at your special selection again.~
@4292 = ~A bracelet you say, let me think...~
@4293 = ~Hmmm... I just might have seen it. Bracelet with a large red stone, very valuable I would think. Maybe even magical?~
@4294 = ~Ah... I see. But if I am not entirely mistaken, your little memento IS actually rather valuable, and even more so to you, it would seem.~
@4295 = ~So, if I were to have this item you seek, how much exactly would it be worth to you in gold?~
@4296 = ~How about 100 gold pieces?~
@4297 = ~How about 500 gold pieces?~
@4298 = ~How about 1000 gold pieces?~
@4299 = ~How about 2000 gold pieces?~
@4300 = ~How about 5000 gold pieces?~
@4301 = ~Bah! Do you take me for a complete idiot or are you just trying to insult me? The gem in this bracelet alone is worth much more than that. If you really want this bracelet, you'll pay no less than 1500 gold pieces.~
@4302 = ~OK, I guess I have no choice but to pay. Here you go.~
@4303 = ~I'm sorry, I don't think I can afford to pay that much. Maybe you could reconsider your offer?~
@4304 = ~I'm sorry, I don't have that much money. Is there any way you could reconsider your offer?~
@4305 = ~Well, I guess that's an offer I could consider...~
@4306 = ~OK, 1000 gold here and now and the bracelet is yours. Deal?~
@4307 = ~OK, it's a deal. Here you go.~
@4308 = ~OK, 2000 gold here and now and the bracelet is yours. Deal?~
@4309 = ~OK, 5000 gold here and now and the bracelet is yours. Deal?~
@4310 = ~No, I'm afraid I won't part with it for any less. I will have no difficulties in finding a buyer at this price.~
@4311 = ~We don't have the money right now, but we will will come back as soon as we can get the money together.~
@4312 = ~OK. I'll pay what you asked. Here you go.~
@4313 = ~Very well, but you'd better hurry. I can't promise that I'll have the bracelet for very long. These kinds of things have quite the demand, you know.~
@4314 = ~Might be, might be. What exactly would you be interested in?~
@4315 = ~Hmmm... You wouldn't happen to have any nice bracelets, would you? Something with a big red stone?~
@4316 = ~I heard someone sold you a bracelet with a big red stone. Is this true?~
@4317 = ~Hmmm... Might be, might be. Bracelet with a large red stone, very valuable I would think. Maybe even magical?~
@4318 = ~Not really; I've just carried it for a long time and grown rather fond of it. Sentimental value, you know.~
@4319 = ~As it so happens, I might have something to suit your tastes. Does this look like something you had in mind?~
@4320 = ~How much?~
@4321 = ~Mmm... yes, I thought this would satisfy your needs.~
@4322 = ~A very special price just for you, my friend - 700 gold pieces.~
@4323 = ~OK, it's a deal.~
@4324 = ~Come on, surely you can do better than that? It's not even in mint condition; look at all those scratches.~
@4325 = ~No can do, my friend. Can't you go any lower?~
@4326 = ~Ñice doing business with you, friend.~
@4327 = ~Ah, you drive a hard bargain my friend. I'll give you my very best price - 500 gold. That's as low as I can go.~
@4328 = ~OK, that's more like it. It's a deal.~
@4329 = ~No, I'm afraid I won't part with it for any less. You are already getting it at a very good price.~
@4330 = ~I could get much more from other buyers; I just happen to like your face. Take it or leave it.~
@4331 = ~No, I'm afraid I won't part with it for any less. You are already getting it at a very good price. I could get much more from other buyers; I just happen to like your face. Take it or leave it.~
@4332 = ~Well, what do you say?~
@4333 = ~No; I told you that's as low as I'll go. If you want the bracelet, you'd better just find the money somewhere.~
@4334 = ~Well, it seems this is your lucky day. Yes, I still have the bracelet. Give me the money and it's yours.~
@4335 = ~OK, here you go.~
@4336 = ~Nice doing business with you. Seeing that you have a taste for unusual items, might I interest you in some specialities that have ended up in my hands?~
@4337 = ~Yes, let me see what you have.~
@4338 = ~No, thanks. I would like to see your regular selection instead.~
@4339 = ~No, I don't think I'm interested.~
@4340 = ~Ah, I knew you had an appreciation for quality tools.~
@4341 = ~Now this looks interesting - let me take a closer look at that...~
@4342 = ~Hmmm... Seems that the Blade of Roses here has something missing. Se this cavity at the end of the pommel here? If I recalls me lore correctly, it ought to have a large cabochon ruby in it. Too bad that it's fallen off somewhere; seems that the weight's a bit off because of it. So if I were you, I'd be on the lookout for any largish rounded rubies that might fit here. It'd make one fine sword even finer.~
@4343 = ~I'll keep that in mind. Do I have anything else you could use?~
@4344 = ~Easy there now - I recognise that gem set on that bracelet... what an odd place for it. This bracelet itself is worth next to nothing - it's not even real silver. What's interesting is why this gem was ever put on it... I cannot fathom, but... ~
@4345 = ~Easy there lass, I meant no offense. But what I was about to say was that this ruby originally comes from a sword known as the Blade of Roses. It must have fallen off at some point in the sword's history. So, you might want to be on the lookout for a beautiful sword, about this long, that's decorated with rose-motif engravings. If you's happen to come across it, I would be more than glad to reunite it with this gem.~
@4346 = ~Well, I can't force it off you, but it'd be a right shame to keep those two pieces apart.~
@4347 = ~I'll be sure to come and see you, Cromwell, if I happen to come across that blade. Do I have anything else that you could use?~
@4348 = ~Well, you heard Amber here. I'm sure that sword would be useful, but if she does not want to give up her bracelet, there is nothing I can do. Do I have anything else that you could use?~
@4349 = ~By the Soul Forger! If this isn't the Blade of Roses itself, I shan't be called a smith no longer. Before I met you, I never even knew this sword was missing a piece and here they both are. So, shall we put it together for you already?~
@4350 = ~Hrm. Right. I'll just see if you have something else then.~
@4351 = ~Good, good, I'm glad you made that decision.~
@4352 = ~What would you need to combine the gem with the sword?~
@4353 = ~I don't think I want to combine them after all. Do I have anything else you could work with?~
@4354 = ~Let's see then...~
@4355 = ~Well, there ye go, me friend.  Use it well.  And if ye comes across anything else of interest, ye knows where to bring it, aye?~
@4356 = ~Now this here be interesting...~
@4357 = ~Ain't really my speciality, but I know that ol' Rashryn would love ta set his eyes on this cat hide ya got 'ere.~
@4358 = ~Ya should drop by 'im at the Promenade - I reckon he could make sumthin' outta it for ya.~
@4359 = ~Hmm.  Looks like ye've nothing amongst yer goods that I could work with.  If ye come across anything interesting later, friend, ye knows where to come, aye? An' in the meantime, just go see ol' Rashryn, will ya.~
@4360 = ~Ain't quite what I like ta work with, but I know that ol' Rashryn could have sum ideas about this 'ere reptile skin.~
@4361 = ~Wyvern, is it? I reckon you could give 'im a call over at Waukeen's - I could bet ya me left hand that he could make sumthin' outta it for ya.~
@4362 = ~Ain't quite what I like ta work with, but I know that ol' Rashryn could have sum ideas about these 'ere skins ya got.~
@4363 = ~Wyvern, is it? And some sorta big cat, by the looks o' this other one. I reckon you should give Rashryn a call over at Waukeen's - I could bet ya me left hand that he could make sumthin' outta 'em for ya.~
@4364 = ~Hmmm... Lessee... ~
@4365 = ~No, I don't think so. Anything else of use?~
@4366 = ~No, I don't think so.  Do I have anything else useful?~
@4367 = ~No, I don't think so. Do I have anything else useful?~
@4368 = ~My name is <CHARNAME> and I'm here to report a crime.~
@4369 = ~I don't have time for your troubles right now. I'm here to report a crime.~
@4370 = ~I don't have time for that right now. My companion has been taken by a group of ruffians that I suspect to be involved in slave trade. I was hoping you could give me information on any activity of that type in this region.~
@4371 = ~I will speak to him as soon as possible.~
@4372 = ~Can I then ask for your assistance in return? My companion has been taken by a group of ruffians that I suspect to be involved in slave trade. I was hoping you could give me information on any activity of that type in this region.~
@4373 = ~I will help him.~
@4374 = ~My companion has been taken by a group of ruffians that I suspect to be involved in slave trade. I was hoping you could give me information on any activity of that type in this region.~
@4375 = ~ I'll see what I can do about the genies.~
@4376 = ~My name is <CHARNAME> and I'm here to report a crime. ~
@4377 = ~ I don't have time for that right now. My companion has been taken by a group of ruffians that I suspect to be involved in slave trade. I was hoping you could give me information on any activity of that type in this region.~
@4378 = ~But this is very urgent. I have a serious crime to report!~
@4379 = ~Never mind then. I'll get going.~
@4380 = ~Yes, my adventures are going well.~
@4381 = ~Trust me, I'll be careful.~
@4382 = ~So you have come to add your troubles to mine? If someone has wronged you, I can only assume that you brought it on yourself. You positively reek of arrogance. You may not be the one behind our current troubles, but I will watch you nonetheless.~
@4383 = ~That is your right. Perhaps I could look into your troubles to demonstrate my trustworthiness?~
@4384 = ~Then watch as I leave. I will not suffer your judgement, or that of any other. I leave you to your problems.~
@4385 = ~Oh. I already hoped that you would be here to assist us with *our* problems. But very well, what is the crime you want to report?~
@4386 = ~I'm sorry. I should have had the sense to ask what I can do for you before asking help for myself.~
@4387 = ~Slavers, you say? Unfortunately it is not unheard of, although I'm happy to say it is relatively rare that they would travel this far from Athkatla.~
@4388 = ~Trademeet is a wealthy town; I guess we don't really have enough unfortunate people for them to take advantage of.~
@4389 = ~That being said, if you wish to find you companion, you should probably go to Athkatla and find the slavers' hideout. Slavery is illegal in all of Amn, so you are unlikely to find them in a respectable part of the city. This is as much help as I can offer you.~ 
@4390 = ~That's good to hear.~
@4391 = ~That being said, if you wish to find you companion, you should probably go to Athkatla and find the slavers' hideout. Slavery is illegal in all of Amn, so you are unlikely to find them in a respectable part of the city.~
@4392 = ~If you wish to assist us in dealing with the Genies later, please seek Guildmistress Busya just outside my office. She will be most interested in hiring you, I am sure.~
@4393 = ~Oh. I already hoped that you would be here to offer your assistance to us, my good <MANWOMAN>. But very well, what is the crime you wish to report?~
@4394 = ~I already told you that you are unwelcome here. Now, be gone from my sight.~
@4395 = ~Who in the Nine Hells are you? Why have you barged in here with drawn weapons and attacked my men?~
@4396 = ~Wait, you must be the friends of that infernal creature we captured. I was warned about you, but it seems that my men didn't take that warning seriously enough.~
@4397 = ~So you're the leader of these slavers?  Your cruelty ends this day, scum!~
@4398 = ~So it is you who are responsible for kidnapping Amber. You'd better tell me where she is now!~
@4399 = ~Slavery is illegal, sir, as is kidnapping people! Turn yourself over to the authorities.~
@4400 = ~Excuse me. I think I've got the wrong houseboat.~
@4401 = ~You! How dare you! We were doin' good business in this town before you took out my partner, Lehtinan at the Copper Coronet! Why are you out to ruin me?~
@4402 = ~Wait, you must be the friends of that infernal creature we captured. I was told of you, but it seems that my men didn't manage to kill you after all.~
@4403 = ~Quiet you slaver scum! You brought ruin upon yourself. Kidnapping our friend just gave us another good reason to get rid of you.~
@4404 = ~So it is you who is responsible for kidnapping Amber. You'd better tell me where she is now!~
@4405 = ~Reasons don't matter to the dead.~
@4406 = ~You're finished, slaver! Turn yourself in to the authorities.~
@4407 = ~Kidnapping your friend was nothing but a nice supplement to my income. I have no personal interest in her. And these dregs that we normally deal in could nary be called persons! This is no different than trading in cattle! Speakin' of which, it's about time you were butchered!~
@4408 = ~Responsible? We only did what we were paid to do. Besides, we don't have her anymore. Ymmyrt's men picked her up as soon as she arrived. A feisty creature she was, and I don't miss her in the least. Gave a few of my men some nasty bruises. But her current location is of no consequence to you, for you will not be leaving here alive. At 'em, men!~

@5000 = ~I don't know why you have helped me stranger... It was most unexpected and most definitely unnecessary, but I am grateful nevertheless.~ [m#amb070]
@5001 = ~But I should not tarry here. I have to go and find my sword and the rest of my equipment. They should be somewhere in this stinking place - these brutes took them away when they captured me.~
@5002 = ~And may I ask how are you planning to get your belongings back?~
@5003 = ~I have your belongings right here; the guard surrendered them to me. Here, take them.~
@5004 = ~I can help you look for your belongings.~
@5005 = ~No, you may not. (Amber turns to leave.)~ [m#amb071]
@5006 = ~(Let her go.)~
@5007 = ~Wait! I have your belongings right here; the guard gave them to me. Here, take them.~
@5008 = ~What is it that you want, stranger?~ [m#amb072]
@5009 = ~Well, you could tell me your name for a start. I'm <CHARNAME>, if you're interested.~
@5010 = ~You can call me Amber, but I don't think that's something you really wanted to know. What do you really want from me?~ [m#amb073]
@5011 = ~What do you mean by that? I'm just trying to be friendly.~
@5012 = ~Well, a little compensation for my efforts to save your hide would be nice. It didn't come cheap, you know.~
@5013 = ~Don't make me laugh, <PRO_RACE>! Nobody wants to be friendly with a 'demon'. That's what you believe I am, don't you?~
@5014 = ~Hah! I bet you think that a little demon like me could give you some infernal powers. Or that you could sell me to a circus to be shown around like a mindless beast. Well, think again; I have no powers that I can share and if you plan to capture me, be prepared for a fight.~
@5015 = ~Amber, calm down, please. I'm not here to exploit you and I've had enough dealings with demons that I know you're not one of their kind.~
@5016 = ~Fine! I didn't believe that you are a demon anyway. I've had enough dealings with demons to know you're not one of their kind.~
@5017 = ~Just shut up and leave, will you?~
@5018 = ~Very well. I might have misjudged you. How ironic of me. (Something resembling a smile plays on her lips for a moment before fading away.)~
@5019 = ~How, then, would you propose I compensate for your efforts in saving me from the city guard?~
@5020 = ~No need to compensate, but if you are willing, you could come with me. I could protect you from the city guard from now on.~
@5021 = ~Well, you could come with me. Surely you have some skills that can be of use to me and I could protect you from the city guard from now on.~
@5022 = ~Just get out of my sight. That'll be compensation enough.~
@5023 = ~You? Protect me from the city guard? An interesting thought. Very well, I could just as well follow you - for now.~ [m#amb074]
@5024 = ~Well, look who's talking; the drow damsel in distress who apparently was pathetic enough to need rescuing from the stake. I bet the whole neighbourhood heard you scream for help.~
@5025 = ~What? You look as if you still have something to tell me.~
@5026 = ~Before we go you should know that my ultimate goal is to rescue someone who is like a sister to me. Imoen was taken by the Cowled Wizards.~
@5027 = ~Before we go you should know that my ultimate goal is to track down an evil wizard named Irenicus.~
@5028 = ~Before we go you should know that my ultimate goal is to track down an evil wizard named Irenicus, who is in possession of something that is very important to me.~
@5029 = ~Before we go, you should know that I am currently tracking down a powerful vampire known by the name of Bodhi.~
@5030 = ~Amber, I would like you to meet <PLAYER2>. I think you two might find each other interesting.~
@5031 = ~No, not really. Just keep your eyes sharp and you will do fine.~
@5032 = ~I have changed my mind, I have no need for you. Not now, anyway.~
@5033 = ~I, too, once knew someone who was like a sister to me, and even more... I would have gone to the ends of the world for her.~
@5034 = ~I have never heard of a wizard who goes by that name and I usually steer clear of wizards who seek to use others to satisfy their hunger for power, but I think I will tag along for now nevertheless.~
@5035 = ~I don't like this, but if you change your mind, I'll be in the Five Flagons inn for a couple of days at least - I hear that they're tolerant of strange folk there.~
@5036 = ~Fine. So long then, stranger.~
@5037 = ~We will see about that - I don't think I have known you long enough just yet to trust your judgement.~
@5038 = ~Right, keep your secrets then. But in the future I will expect you to keep me on the level as to what is going on.~
@5039 = ~A vampire? That is not something to be taken lightly. I should probably take some of the extra stakes you have.~
@5040 = ~Erm... Are you trying to tell me that you don't have any stakes with you, <CHARNAME>? If I were you, I would get some before running after any bloodsuckers. Stakes or holy water. I'm not a fan of holy water, though. It makes my skin tingle.~
@5041 = ~That's it. I've had it - I will take no more of this stupidity.~
@5042 = ~Aaaaah! This... this cannot be! Tell me it was but an evil dream! I felt as if I was dead... No, worse than dead... undead...  a vampire! And yet I live again.~ [m#amb137]
@5043 = ~You... you saved me, <CHARNAME>. I would have murdered you if I had the chance. I... I wanted to taste  your blood, feel the ecstasy of drinking it. I have never felt such lust burning my body, I lusted for your life force like I have never lusted for anything. The mere thought of draining it felt wonderful! But you saved me - you slew me.~ [m#amb138]
@5044 = ~Could you not hear me scream for you not to? I-I guess you could not. My soul was so far away and it was only my body that you cut down. But the hate in your eyes... was it for me or only Bodhi? I could not know...~ [m#amb141]
@5045 = ~Hush, Amber. It is all right now. Everything is fine - I have restored you.~
@5046 = ~Seems like you're all right now, Amber. Come on, let's get going.~
@5047 = ~Well, you seem to be fine enough now, but I have some bad news for you. I'm sorry, Amber, but I cannot take you with me.~
@5048 = ~No! Don't touch me! It's not all right! I... ...I feel horrible! Let's just continue our way, please. I need time to think, to get the monster that Bodhi made of me out of my heart.~ [m#amb142]
@5049 = ~Yes, let us leave this place. You will feel better when you feel the sun on your face again.~
@5050 = ~I'm sorry, Amber, but I cannot take you with me.~
@5051 = ~You would restore me just to cast me aside like an old toy, no longer new and interesting? So be it, I shall not trouble you again.~
@5052 = ~Perhaps... At least I don't think I can feel any worse than I do now, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb145]
@5053 = ~Hey, where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. Followed your tracks here - good to see that you're okay. That sorcerer kept some rather nasty things in his house.~ [m#amb129]
@5054 = ~So, should we keep going then?~
@5055 = ~Yeah, let's get going, I should have known you would not show any gratitude for me coming to your rescue.~
@5056 = ~Yes, we should go. I'm glad that you're all right; you had me worried for a while. Seems that me tracking you down turned out to be unnecessary, however.~
@5057 = ~Actually, I don't have room for you right now. Could you go somewhere safe to wait until I need you again?~
@5058 = ~It's not my fault if you run around for nothing. I can take care of myself and you should know that well enough by now.~ [m#amb130]
@5059 = ~You tracked me all the way through Ymmyrt's mansion to tell me that you don't need me anymore? You sure do seem a bit loony sometimes, <CHARNAME>. But who am I to question your decisions.~ [m#amb131]
@5060 = ~I'll be in the Five Flagons inn for a while, if you decide to need me again.~
@5061 = ~What now? Are we going or not?~ [m#amb120]
@5062 = ~I'm sorry Amber, but you have to leave.~
@5063 = ~Oh, never mind Amber. Let's get going.~
@5064 = ~You want me to leave? Are you certain of this? I cannot promise that things will be the same between us when we meet again.~
@5065 = ~I'm afraid so. Just wait here and I'll be back when I need you.~
@5066 = ~Yes, you have to leave for now. Can you go somewhere and wait for me?~
@5067 = ~What was I thinking? Of course I don't want you to leave.~
@5068 = ~Very well. I don't like this, but I'll wait here. Remember that if you don't came back soon, I probably won't be here any more.~
@5069 = ~I don't like this, but I'll find my way to the Five Flagons and wait for you there for a while.~
@5070 = ~I thought so too.~
@5071 = ~Well, it's your loss then. I don't like this, but I'll find my way to the Five Flagons inn and wait there for a while.~
@5072 = ~I'm sorry Amber, but I have no use for you right now.~
@5073 = ~Yes, let's get going, Amber.~
@5074 = ~Well, it's your loss then. I do not like this, but I'll wait here.  Remember that if you don't came back soon, I may not be here any more.~
@5075 = ~Well, it's your loss then. I do not like this, but I'll wait here.~
@5076 = ~Wh-What happened?~
@5077 = ~Thank the gods! I thought I lost you, My love?~
@5078 = ~For a while I thought I lost you there. Are you OK?~
@5079 = ~You were out cold for a while. It seems that I have no room in my party right now; 
  could you just wait here for a while?~
@5080 = ~You were out cold for a while. It seems that I have no room in my party right now; 
  maybe you could go to the Five Flagons inn and rest there for a while.~
@5081 = ~Everything just went black, and then I awoke here, in your arms. I think I'm all right now.~
@5082 = ~Yeah, I think so. Let's get going.~
@5083 = ~Hi! I got what I wanted, let's move on.~
@5084 = ~Um, OK.~
@5085 = ~Aren't you going to tell me what exactly did you get and from where?~
@5086 = ~Where did you find it, exactly, if I'm allowed to be curious?~
@5087 = ~It seems that we have a full crew right now. Could you please go and wait for me at the Five Flagons?~
@5088 = ~I have no room for you any more. And besides, I don't think I need you anyway, so just get lost, will you.~
@5089 = ~It's really none of your business, but if you must know, I just needed to get back something of mine that someone had taken from me.~
@5090 = ~OK. I trust this will not mean any trouble in the future.~
@5091 = ~Could you be any more vague? I'd like to know what exactly did you got and where?~
@5092 = ~Pretty much where I expected it to be. It's really not important. Let's just get going.~
@5093 = ~OK, let's go.~
@5094 = ~Come on, where did you find it? I'd really like to know. Just to be sure there won't be any trouble later on.~
@5095 = ~After going through all the trouble of finding you again? OK, very well. But don't expect me to stay there forever.~
@5096 = ~Fine. I don't understand why I wasted my time with you in the first place.~
@5097 = ~It really isn't any of your business, so would you just let go? Are we going or not?~
@5098 = ~Okay. I trust this will not mean any trouble in the future.~
@5099 = ~It seems that there isn't any room for you right now. Could you please go and wait for me at the Five Flagons?~
@5100 = ~If you're not going to tell me, I think it's best that you leave. And besides, I don't think I need you anyway.~
@5101 = ~Now, mister guard, you just hand over my bracelet before I have to search you for it. I can guarantee you would NOT enjoy that.~
@5102 = ~Fine. I'll go and find this 'Nick', then. For your own sake, I hope you are telling the truth.~
@5103 = ~<CHARNAME>? I need to leave your company for a while.~ [m#amb121]
@5104 = ~But why, Amber? Is something wrong?~
@5105 = ~May I ask why, Amber?~
@5106 = ~Okay, off you go, but don't take too long. I expect you back shortly.~
@5107 = ~Well, go! And don't bother to come back.~
@5108 = ~You're not going anywhere, young lady!~
@5109 = ~Oh, there's nothing wrong, I just need to get back a bracelet of mine. Its value is mainly sentimental, but I wish to have it back regardless. I could not find it anywhere so the guards must have taken it.~
@5110 = ~So you plan to go back and reclaim that bracelet of yours from the guards? I'd better come with you.~
@5111 = ~Well, go fetch that bracelet, but be careful and come back swiftly.~
@5112 = ~Okay - I think I'll be back within the day. I'll just look you up when I'm done.~
@5113 = ~Got up on the wrong side of the bed, did you? Well, don't worry - I won't come back to bother you anymore.~
@5114 = ~Who do you think you are to make such threats? There is no way you can stop me from leaving!~
@5115 = ~If you insist. Let's get back to the prison then, shall we?~
@5116 = ~No, I think you have butchered enough of the city guard for now. I'll handle this myself; quick and clean. I'll look you up when I'm done.~
@5117 = ~Okay, I will.~
@5118 = ~Hey, you! You've still got something of mine! Be a nice boy and hand me back my bracelet, and you'll save yourself a lot of trouble.~ [m#amb122]
@5119 = ~Did you think I wouldn't notice? Oh, I forgot: you're not supposed to think. What spell does one cast when in need of you people? Oh, that's right - 'Summon idiots'.~ [m#amb124]
@5120 = ~What? We came here to get my bracelet and that's exactly what I intend to do. With or without you.~
@5121 = ~All right, but I hope you know what you are doing here.~
@5122 = ~Don't be silly. Of course I'm with you on this. I just don't agree with your methods here.~
@5123 = ~If that's how you were planning to handle this, it would probably be better if I got out of your way. You can come back and join me when you are done being rude to people.~
@5124 = ~If that's your idea of how to handle things, I think we'd be better off if each of us just went our separate ways. I just don't work that way.~
@5125 = ~Stop patronising me, will you? Of course I know what I'm doing.~
@5126 = ~And you, just hand over my bracelet before I have to search you for it. I can guarantee you would NOT enjoy that.~
@5127 = ~How do *you* think we should go about this then? Ask them politely whether they would be kind enough to give me back the possessions they stole from me? That just doesn't cut it with these people. If you want to get something out of them, you'll just have to show them you're faster, smarter and tougher than them, and that's exactly what I'm doing here, so please stop interfering.~
@5128 = ~I guess you have more experience dealing with this type of people. I just hope you know what you are doing...~
@5129 = ~Okay, but could you just try and be a little less offensive? I think they would still get your point.~
@5130 = ~The only thing you are doing here is landing yourself in trouble again. No wonder they locked you up in the first place.~
@5131 = ~Fine. I am more than capable of handling this myself, so if you'll excuse me...~
@5132 = ~Now, hand over that bracelet before I have to search you for it. I can guarantee you would *not* enjoy that.~
@5133 = ~If that's how you feel, you'll hear no objection from me. I'll just be on my way then...~
@5134 = ~I was nowhere near as offensive as I should have been, considering how they treated me earlier. If it had been you, you would be a lot less complacent.~
@5135 = ~Now, hand over that bracelet before I have to search you for it. I can guarantee you would NOT enjoy that.~
@5136 = ~You think I got locked up for being offensive to people? Did it at any point cross your mind that I might be offensive BECAUSE they locked me up for no reason whatsoever? I bet even you would be somewhat miffed after that kind of treatment. And you can be sure that this was not the first time, either.~
@5137 = ~I'm sorry; I had no idea...~
@5138 = ~My apologies. That was quite improper of me. Forget that I said anything.~
@5139 = ~Sheesh! No need to get all melodramatic at me. I was just trying to point out that you don't need to be so rude to people all the time.~
@5140 = ~And I'm not that convinced that you ever will. So, why don't you just let me get over with this without interfering at every turn?~
@5141 = ~Okay. I'll try to stay out of the way. I just hope you know what you're doing.~
@5142 = ~I was just trying to point out you don't need to be so rude at people all the time. That's all.~
@5143 = ~You know nothing about what I need or don't need, so just stay out of it, will you?~
@5144 = ~Well, at least you are smart enough to see when you've said something stupid and <MANWOMAN> enough to admit it. Apology accepted.~
@5145 = ~Now you mister guard, just hand over my bracelet before I have to search you for it. I can guarantee you would NOT enjoy that.~
@5146 = ~Fine. I'll go and find this 'Nick' then. If I find that you've been dishonest with me, you will be very sorry for having lied to me.~
@5147 = ~No, I think you're lying, Nick. Do you really want us to go back to Ed and learn that you lied to us? If you're planning to 'disappear' in the meantime, forget it. There's no way you can hide from me.~ [m#amb125]
@5148 = ~Somehow this lowlife doesn't seem to be as drunk or stupid as he pretends to be...~ [m#amb126]
@5149 = ~It's made of silver and it has a large red stone attached to it. Sound familiar?~
@5150 = ~Not really; I've just carried it for a long time and grown rather fond of it. Sentimental value, you know.~
@5151 = ~No! You can't sell my bracelet to anyone else; I will come up with the money by myself if I have to.~
@5152 = ~<CHARNAME>, if you will not help me get my bracelet back, I will have to leave and find my fortune elsewhere. How is it going to be?~
@5153 = ~OK, I guess I have no choice but to pay. Here you go.~
@5154 = ~I'm sorry, but I don't think I can invest that much into your bracelet. Go and find the money yourself.~
@5155 = ~We don't have the money right now, but I'll promise that we will come back as soon as we can get the money together.~
@5156 = ~Fine. I see that you value your gold more than your companions. I'll be much better off without you.~
@5157 = ~Fine, but you'd better keep your word on this one.~
@5158 = ~(Amber nods her head almost imperceptibly as she gazes intently at the silver bracelet the fence produced from among her wares.)~
@5159 = ~OK, now we have enough money to buy back my bracelet. Time to keep your promise.~
@5160 = ~OK. Let's go there right away and get this over with.~
@5161 = ~OK, but we'll just have to take care of the business at hand first. We'll visit the Thieves' Guild as soon as we can, OK?~
@5162 = ~Oh, that. I decided we're not going to waste all that time and money for such an insignificant trinket. You'll just have to make do without your bracelet.~
@5163 = ~OK, but this better not take long...~
@5164 = ~You lying bastard! I should have known that you can't be trusted and not have wasted my time on you.~
@5165 = ~Shouldn't we be somewhere else already?~
@5166 = ~Oh, your bracelet. I'm sorry, it must have slipped my mind amidst all this confusion. Let's go and take care of it right away.~
@5167 = ~I know, I know. There have just been so many other things to do... I promise we'll take care of it as soon as we can.~
@5168 = ~What do you mean?~
@5169 = ~The thieves' guild, my bracelet, remember?~
@5170 = ~Oh, your bracelet. I'm sorry, I completely forgot it. Let's take care of it right away.~
@5171 = ~Oh, that. I decided that we should just forget it. Too much trouble.~
@5172 = ~Better not forget it this time... I expect you to keep your promise, and to do it in a timely manner.~
@5173 = ~It has already taken longer than it should have. I'll not wait much longer.~
@5174 = ~That's it. You obviously have no intention of keeping your promise, and I've had enough of your excuses. I don't need you for this or for anything else, for that matter. I'm going now.~
@5175 = ~Thank you <CHARNAME>; I feel much better now that I have my bracelet back.~
@5176 = ~I thought we were supposed to go and pick up my bracelet from the guards? I hope you haven't forgotten.~
@5177 = ~Oh, I'm sorry, let's go there right away and get it sorted out.~
@5178 = ~I know I promised that I'd help you, but we'll have to take care of the present situation first.~
@5179 = ~I know I promised that I'd help you, but is there any way you could take care of it by yourself? I have other matters I should take care of in the meantime.~
@5180 = ~I decided that your bracelet isn't worth the trouble after all. If you want to go after it, by all means do so, but I'm not interested, OK?~
@5181 = ~Very well, but it would better not take very long.~
@5182 = ~Well, in that case you shouldn't have come with me in the first place. I have no interest in staying with people who turn back on their word. I can very well take care of myself.~
@5183 = ~We still haven't done anything to get back my bracelet. If you are not going to help me get it back, just say so; otherwise we should get to the prison before they throw it away.~
@5184 = ~Oh, right, let's go then.~
@5185 = ~Well, to be perfectly honest with you, I don't think I'm interested in finding your bracelet after all.~
@5186 = ~<CHARNAME>, we'd better check out the Sea's Bounty and see if this Nick fellow is still there. I'd like to find my bracelet as soon as possible. If you feel you're otherwise occupied, I am more than capable of taking care of it myself.~
@5187 = ~Okay, let's go check the place out right away.~
@5188 = ~I'll come with you, but it will have to wait until we take care of the task at hand.~
@5189 = ~Well, if you can handle it yourself, I do have some other things to take care of.~
@5190 = ~Okay, I can understand that, but it better not take too long, or otherwise I'll have to go take care of it by myself.~
@5191 = ~Of course I can handle it myself. I just wish you would have a little faith in my abilities. This shouldn't take very long; I'll just look you up when I'm done.~
@5192 = ~I'm afraid I will have to go and find this 'Nick' before he disappears altogether. I'll be back after I find the bracelet.~
@5193 = ~<CHARNAME>, I feel we should pay a visit to the thieves' guild before my bracelet escapes us further. If you feel you're otherwise occupied, I am more than capable of taking care of it myself.~
@5194 = ~Okay, let's go see the fence right away.~
@5195 = ~I'm afraid I will have to visit the thieves' guild right away before the bracelet moves further away. I'll find you after I'm done.~
@5196 = ~<CHARNAME>, considering the Shadow Thieves are now your enemies, I don't think it would be wise for us to visit them as a group. This job requires both stealth and intelligence - I'd better go alone.~ [m#amb127]
@5197 = ~I'll look you up when I'm done.~
@5198 = ~Hey, get your hands off my bracelet, you greedy dwarf!~
@5199 = ~Now just wait a minute! This bracelet happens to be very valuable to me, so don't you be saying it's worthless. Not everything can be measured in gold, dwarf.~
@5200 = ~To be honest, I'm not sure if I want my bracelet to be maimed, even if we ever find the sword.~
@5201 = ~No <CHARNAME>, I will not give up my bracelet! The sword is fine as it is.~
@5202 = ~Amber, you will not be any less of a friend to Jill even if that stone is set back in the sword. Memories like that never fade. You do not need some trinket to remember her by.~
@5203 = ~Surrender that bracelet now, Amber. This is no time for such foolishness.~
@5204 = ~All right Amber, I'll respect that. Let the sword remain as it is. Do I have anything else that would be of interest?~
@5205 = ~How thick is your skull, anyway? I said NO.~
@5206 = ~Hmmm... I guess you're right. Here, have the bracelet. The sword will be of more use anyway.~
@5207 = ~Who are you? I don't believe I've ever met you or this employer of yours before. I don't think I'll...~ [m#amb128]
@5208 = ~So, <CHARNAME>, how did you end up in Athkatla in the first place?~ [m#amb075]
@5209 = ~I did not have much choice in that matter. The wizard Irenicus captured me after I had left Baldur's Gate.~
@5210 = ~I'm an adventurer, Amber. I have travelled in many parts of Faerûn. Amn was just a place I had not yet visited.~
@5211 = ~Not now, Amber. We don't have time for this. Maybe later.~
@5212 = ~I don't think that's really any of your business.~
@5213 = ~Baldur's Gate? That's quite far north from here. It seems that the wizard spared no trouble in seeking you out. I wonder why he's so interested in you. You certainly don't look all that special to me.~ [m#amb076]
@5214 = ~You might be surprised if you knew just how special I am. And so will the wizard when we catch up with him. Then he will learn not to cross me.~
@5215 = ~You might be surprised if you knew just how special I am. Although I don't really care what the wizard wanted; I just want to find Imoen.~
@5216 = ~I have no idea. Well, I do have some kind of an idea, but the truth of his intentions will remain a mystery until we catch up with him. Then he will learn not to cross me. ~
@5217 = ~I have no idea. Well, I have some kind of an idea, but the Cowled Wizards have taken Imoen and I am going to get her back first. I don't really care what the wizard wanted.~
@5218 = ~Who knows. Look, Amber, I really don't like people prying into my affairs, so try to cut down on the questions, all right?~
@5219 = ~So it was him who caused all that fuss on the Promenade? I overheard some guards talking about it.~
@5220 = ~So it was her who caused all that fuss on the Promenade? I overheard some guards talking about it.~
@5221 = ~OK, let me get this straight. The girl and the older wizard were captured by the Cowled Wizards and now you're after them? Quite a task you have set yourself - the Cowled Ones do not tolerate people mingling in their business.~
@5222 = ~This just might prove interesting, after all.~ [m#amb077]
@5223 = ~Really? You certainly don't look old enough to have travelled that much, but what do I know. Looks can be deceiving.~ [m#amb078]
@5224 = ~Umm... Maybe I was exaggerating a bit. Truth be told, I did not have much choice in coming to Athkatla. The wizard Irenicus captured me soon after I left Baldur's Gate.~
@5225 = ~Yeah, you should know that.~
@5226 = ~Look, Amber, I really don't like people prying into my affairs, so try to cut back on the questioning, all right.~
@5227 = ~You're a jolly fellow aren't you? I was merely trying to strike up a conversation. We can walk in silence from now on, if that's what you wish.~ [m#amb079]
@5228 = ~Yes, please do shut up.~
@5229 = ~Please don't get me wrong Amber, I just have a lot of things on my mind right now. Perhaps we can talk about something else later on?~
@5230 = ~Whatever, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb080]
@5231 = ~<CHARNAME>, may I ask you something? It's a bit personal, but I feel I do have the right to know.~ [m#amb081]
@5232 = ~Yes, Amber, what is it?~
@5233 = ~If you insist. However, I don't see how you would have the right to know anything about my personal life.~
@5234 = ~No, not now. We don't have time for this. Maybe later.~
@5235 = ~No, I have no desire to discuss anything personal with the likes of you. Not now or ever.~
@5236 = ~Fine, silence is OK by me, but let's get one thing straight right here and now. There is no such thing as 'the likes of me' and I have no desire to be at the receiving end of your inane generalisations.~
@5237 = ~Whatever you say. As I said, I have no desire to speak to you. As long as you pull your weight, however, you are welcome to stay.~
@5238 = ~On a second thought, that could prove rather uncomfortable in the long run. Could you just come back with your questions sometime later?~
@5239 = ~Whatever.~ [m#amb080]
@5240 = ~What are you? You're not all <PRO_RACE>, are you? And don't you give me that look. I have gathered enough from the whispers of the people around you and the looks of the passersby to realise that there is more to you than meets the eye.~ [m#amb082]
@5241 = ~Very well. Have you heard of the prophesies of Alaundo?~
@5242 = ~I really don't know if I should be discussing this with you, Amber.~
@5243 = ~My heritage is none of your business. Don't bother me with this again.~
@5244 = ~I would gladly hear it from you instead of getting an exaggerated version from someone else. I'd rather not judge you based on half-whispered rumours and empty speculation about your supposed heritage; I know first hand what that can lead to.~
@5245 = ~Yes I have. (Amber's almond-shaped eyes widen a bit.) You're not saying that... ...you're one of the children?~
@5246 = ~I was once mistaken for one of your kind. Nearly got me burned at a stake. It seems that my heritage is quite insignificant compared to yours.~
@5247 = ~Why don't you, then, tell me of your heritage in exchange?~
@5248 = ~Well, you got what you wanted, let's move on, shall we?~
@5249 = ~I will take that under consideration, but it will have to wait for later. I... I will need to ponder this. Besides, we should move on; we have no more time for small talk.~
@5250 = ~You were quite brave revealing your heritage to me, <CHARNAME>. I guess it would only be fair for me to return the favour. Would you like to hear about my past?~ [m#amb083]
@5251 = ~Yes, please tell me of your family. I have not seen many of your kind before.~
@5252 = ~Spare me from it, will you. I have no interest in you beyond the skills that can help me on my quest.~
@5253 = ~I'm interested in hearing more of you, but now is not a very good time.~
@5254 = ~Well, I don't care if we travel in silence from now on, but is that what you really want?~
@5255 = ~Yes, I took you along for your skills, not for your chit chat.~
@5256 = ~On a second thought, silence could prove rather uncomfortable in the long run. Could you just come back with your questions at some later time?~
@5257 = ~I would have been happier if you'd had time to talk now, but I'll see if I have time later.~ [m#amb084]
@5258 = ~I'd be surprised if you had. Fortunately we are few in number here on the face of Faerûn.~ [m#amb085]
@5259 = ~Fortunately? You don't seem proud of your heritage.~
@5260 = ~Fortunately indeed. You tieflings have quite the reputation for spreading havoc wherever you go.~
@5261 = ~You tieflings? That's just what I'm talking about. It tends to get rather depressing once you hear it all the time, wherever you go. I have to admit the reputation is often well deserved, but it also tends to deprive one of the benefit of the doubt.~
@5262 = ~How would you feel if people prejudiced by the actions of your kin would condemn you at every turn without even knowing you? Tieflings have a reputation for bringing trouble. Mostly it's a well deserved one, but it also tends to deprive one of the benefit of the doubt.~
@5263 = ~Though, considering your background... I think you will receive a fair share of suspicion and fear; undoubtedly you have already tasted it.~
@5264 = ~You could say that, but let's not talk about me for a change. I would like to know about you instead.~
@5265 = ~But how are tieflings born? That's something I have always wanted to know.~
@5266 = ~Well, I don't see how much there is to know, really. Tieflings are born as a result of a demonic presence touching their ancestors. That's actually the nice way to put it; in reality fear and suffering are all that come out of it.~
@5267 = ~There certainly must be happy memories in your past as well, Amber. I, for instance, grew up in Candlekeep - I knew nothing of my heritage back then.~
@5268 = ~Are you sure that you're not being too hard on yourself? I can recall many nice things from the past, from my time in Candlekeep, even though I was an orphan. Things have turned much darker since I learned who my father was, though.~
@5269 = ~Perhaps you're right. Life has certainly been much more complicated since I left Candlekeep behind and became aware of my destiny.~
@5270 = ~I'll ask for your opinion when I want one, bard.~
@5271 = ~Well, ignorance is bliss, isn't it. I grow tired of this conversation. I do not wish to dwell in the past - there are too many painful memories, and even the happy ones have been soured by time.~ [m#amb086]
@5272 = ~You said that you lived your childhood in Candlekeep. That's the place where old, grumpy sages sit with their noses in the books, isn't it?~ [m#amb087]
@5273 = ~Well yes, that's one way to describe the place, but there was certainly more than just grumpy old sages.~
@5274 = ~Watch your tone, lass. I will not listen you insult the place I called home for so long.~
@5275 = ~Yes, and I'm glad I'm on the road now. If I had been forced to watch one more year of those sages growing moss on themselves, I think I would have gone insane.~
@5276 = ~I did not doubt that, but you must understand that that's how Candlekeep is seen by many of those who have never been there.~
@5277 = ~A bit touchy are we? It was not meant as an insult. Believe me when I say that you will know if I ever feel like insulting you.~
@5278 = ~Well, I think you should be more appreciative of having been given the chance to grow up in peace. Being an ungrateful sod won't get you too far in life.~
@5279 = ~Anyway, I gather that - given your heritage - you probably didn't live there with your father. But didn't your mother take care of you? Or were you just a vagrant child living at the mercy of others?~
@5280 = ~I never knew my mother, but Gorion - my foster father - took good and loving care of me. So no, I definitely wasn't a vagrant.~
@5281 = ~A vagrant? Hardly. Gorion, my foster father, was quite powerful and well respected - being a Harper and all. His circle of friends included people like Elminster; not many men can even dream about such company.~
@5282 = ~I know hardly anything about my mother. My foster father Gorion refused to reveal anything significant about her.~
@5283 = ~I don't know what you're trying to accomplish with your name dropping, but I can tell you that it's not working.~
@5284 = ~Well, he probably had a good reason for it.  A woman chosen by an evil god to carry his offspring certainly wouldn't be ordinary.~
@5285 = ~It certainly sounds like you should consider yourself lucky for your sheltered, if perhaps ignorant childhood.~
@5286 = ~Ignorant?~
@5287 = ~Well, you certainly didn't need to starve or face other hardships while you were a child. Things might be different now, but a trip to the Dock Ward of Waterdeep might make you see the world in a new light.~ [m#amb088]
@5288 = ~Call me intrusive if you wish, but I'll ask anyway. This man that you stopped in Baldur's Gate - the one who tried to incite a war with Amn - I've heard people say that he was attempting to make himself a god.~ [m#amb089]
@5289 = ~They also say that he was your brother. Is this true?~
@5290 = ~Yes I'm afraid it is. Sarevok is... was my brother.~
@5291 = ~Sarevok is indeed my brother and I don't think it is anything to be ashamed of.~
@5292 = ~To tell you the truth, I'm not very comfortable with you prying into my family affairs.~
@5293 = ~Is that so? Well, I guess I can understand that.~
@5294 = ~Well, I'm glad that you can. Now, let's move on.~
@5295 = ~If you really want to know, then yes, Sarevok was my brother.~
@5296 = ~So you killed your own brother, eh? Did you grow up together or -~
@5297 = ~I did not murder my brother! He was trying to steal my destiny from me and start a war; I had to stop him!~
@5298 = ~What are you implying? I had no other means but violence to stop him.~
@5299 = ~I will not discuss this any further with you. Not if you're accusing me of something I had no say in.~
@5300 = ~He murdered my foster father! I had every right to avenge that!~
@5301 = ~He was planning to become the Lord of Murder! If I had not stopped him, who would have?~
@5302 = ~Huh? I can certainly sense some repressed feelings here. I was not accusing you of anything. I merely wanted to know if he was close to you. I mean, it would have made stopping his plans considerably more difficult.~
@5303 = ~Thank you for trusting me, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps we can continue this discussion later?~
@5304 = ~So, we got your relationship with your brother sorted out, but what about Imoen? You grew up with her didn't you?~ [m#amb091]
@5305 = ~Yes, Imoen has always been like a little sister to me. Her courage and spirit have always been encouraging even if she doesn't always take things seriously enough.~
@5306 = ~Yes, she lived in Candlekeep, but we're not as close as she likes to imply.~
@5307 = ~Yes, we grew up together and yes, we are friends.~
@5308 = ~Oh, is that so? Can I ask why? You seem to take her friendship quite lightly.~
@5309 = ~I've known her since childhood, but I guess the trials along the road exposed our differences. She refuses to take anything seriously, and that irritates me.~
@5310 = ~Since I left Candlekeep, I have met people who have become much closer to me than Imoen ever was. It's not that she is a bad person, and I do wish the best for her, but after we rescue her, our paths shall separate.~
@5311 = ~Since I left Candlekeep, I have met people who have become much closer to me than Imoen ever was. It's not that she is a bad person, and I do wish the best for her, but I think we are better off going our separate paths.~
@5312 = ~I feel naught but pity for that silly brat. And I will risk my life and that of my companions to rescue her. What else could one ask of me?~
@5313 = ~I feel naught but pity for that silly brat. And I did risk my life and that of my companions to rescue her. What else could one ask of me?~
@5314 = ~Oh, please. I don't give a damn about that stupid girl. She can blame only herself for getting into all this trouble. She should have stayed in Candlekeep washing dishes for Winthrop.~
@5315 = ~To be honest, I'm glad that she is gone. At last I can get some respite from her. The way she always trails after me like a lost puppy - there is just no way to shake her off!~
@5316 = ~To be honest, I'm glad that she spent all that time stranded in Spellhold. Gave me some long-awaited respite from her. The way she always trails after me like a lost puppy - there is just no way to shake her off!~
@5317 = ~She opened my cage during the attack on Irenicus' dungeon. I suppose I owe her for that, but that's it. After we find her, she'll be on her own again.~
@5318 = ~I really don't want to discuss my relationship with Imoen with anybody.~
@5319 = ~So light-heartedness ticks you off? I'll have to keep that in mind.~
@5320 = ~That may well be true, but I would not cast a friend aside so lightly. Especially someone who knows what you are and still remains by your side.~
@5321 = ~Some respect for her affection?~
@5322 = ~I see that you're not very different from everyone else, then. But I guess that's the way of the world: if you can't make it on your own, don't count on anyone helping you out. It's a pity, really.~
@5323 = ~So, it's all about getting even for you? I guess that's your reason for going after this Irenicus, too. Funny. Personally, I have rarely found revenge to be rewarding to any degree.~
@5324 = ~I don't think I should pry further into your personal life, then.~
@5325 = ~I'm still looking forward to meeting Imoen, even if you don't approve of her. Based on what I've heard of her, she reminds me a little of a girl I knew a long time ago. Although I doubt that I'll ever meet anyone like Jill again; she was like a sister to me, and a true friend.~
@5326 = ~Who is this mysterious Jill I keep hearing of? Sounds like you were really close.~
@5327 = ~Jill this and Jill that. Don't you ever talk about anyone else? Is she like the only person you have ever known or what?~
@5328 = ~Yeah, well, we really should get going now if we intend to get anything done today.~
@5329 = ~Although I can understand your decision, I'm still sad that you made Imoen leave. She reminds me a little of a girl I knew a long time ago. Although I doubt that I'll ever meet anyone like Jill again; she was like a sister to me, and a true friend.~
@5330 = ~I have to say that I like Imoen, even if you don't approve of her. She reminds me a little of a girl I knew a long time ago. Although I doubt that I'll ever meet anyone like Jill again; she was like a sister to me, and a true friend.~
@5331 = ~Then you really must want to get her back. At least I would have gone to the ends of the world for Jill if someone had captured her. She was like a sister to me, and a true friend. I doubt that I'll ever meet anyone like her.~
@5332 = ~Then you must be really happy for having her back. I would have gone to the ends of the world for Jill if someone had captured her. She was like a sister to me, and a true friend. I doubt that I'll ever meet anyone like her.~
@5333 = ~Then I don't see why you made her leave. I would have gone to the ends of the world for Jill, had someone captured her. She was like a sister to me, and a true friend. I doubt that I'll ever meet anyone like her again.~
@5334 = ~Whatever you say, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb062]
@5335 = ~She is - I mean was - a bard and a great adventurer. I travelled with her and her brother all the way to Icewind Dale and back. It feels as if it was ages ago. Well, it has been quite a few years, actually... Much has happened since she-~ [m#amb264]
@5336 = ~Dwelling on old memories is not going to get anything done. We should get going.~ [m#amb092]
@5337 = ~You should watch your tone when talking about Jill, <CHARNAME>. I'll forgive you this once since you are obviously someone who has never known a true friend.~ [m#amb093]
@5338 = ~<CHARNAME>, why did you put aside your quest in order to find me? You should have known by now that I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself.~ [m#amb094]
@5339 = ~I've put in the effort to save your hide twice now, first from the guards and now from Ymmyrt. I think you should be more grateful.~
@5340 = ~Actually I would not be so sure of myself, if I were you. If you were as good as you seem to think, I wouldn't always have to look after you in combat.~
@5341 = ~That's true enough, but it doesn't mean that I wouldn't still look after my companions.~
@5342 = ~Yes, yes, I get it. Must you still go on about it?~
@5343 = ~And both of those times have been prime examples of effort wasted on something that would have happened anyway. But on the other hand, if your curiosity hadn't dragged you to my cell door, we might never have met.~
@5344 = ~Well, maybe I would do better if I didn't constantly have to look over my shoulder to make sure you're not getting in the way.~
@5345 = ~But you would be much closer to catching up with Irenicus had you not come after me.~
@5346 = ~But I do appreciate your concern for my well-being, whatever strange reason you have for it. And I wouldn't want you to think otherwise.~ [m#amb095]
@5347 = ~Is that really the closest thing to 'thank you' you can come up with? Come on, put a *little* effort into it, if you can.~
@5348 = ~I guess that's as close as you'll get to showing gratitude. Better than nothing, I suppose.~
@5349 = ~I don't, Amber. And I want you to know that you can always count on me.~
@5350 = ~Yes, yes, that's all cleared up now. Must you still go on about it?~
@5351 = ~That's what you'll have to settle for, <CHARNAME>. At least for now.~
@5352 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@5353 = ~No, I most certainly don't have to.~
@5354 = ~A moment of your time, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb096]
@5355 = ~What's on your mind, Amber? You look like it is something important.~
@5356 = ~Again? Very well, you can have a moment of my time, but make it quick - we don't have all day.~
@5357 = ~Not right now, Amber. Can you come back later?~
@5358 = ~Well, excuse me, Jaheira. I didn't realise that I had to go through you if I wanted to speak to <CHARNAME>. What are you now, <PRO_HISHER> herald? If that's so, I'd say you still have some work to do in the announcements department.~
@5359 = ~Do not make the mistake of thinking that you can boss me around.~
@5360 = ~<CHARNAME>? Can I have moment of your time?~
@5361 = ~I don't know if it's that important, but I would like your opinion on something I often wonder myself.~ [m#amb300]
@5362 = ~How do you feel about using your divinely granted powers? Do you use them without a second thought or do you feel that you should somehow try to ignore them and survive with your mortal abilities alone?~ [m#amb097]
@5363 = ~I see no harm in using whatever powers I have been given. I see them as a gift, and refusing to use them would seem ungrateful.~
@5364 = ~I use my powers, but I strive to do so only for good ends. I don't think that I am bound to my father's evil. I believe I can choose my own path.~
@5365 = ~I try to fight back, but sometimes it is so very hard. The urge to wield the power I have been given is often too strong.~
@5366 = ~You have seen nothing yet, Amber. Bhaal's legacy is my destiny and some day I will rise to wield his power to its fullest potential.~
@5367 = ~I see. Well, at least you seem to be certain what to do with your so called gift.~ [m#amb098]
@5368 = ~I, on the other hand, feel somewhat ambivalent about the things *I* can do. Granted, my powers have merely a fiendish origin, as opposed to your divine roots, but they are both derived from something utterly evil.~
@5369 = ~I can make people go blind - and even worse - and sometimes I feel that nothing good can ever come out of using my powers. The first time I blinded someone - a mighty nobleman in Luskan, and totally by accident, mind you - I almost got myself killed. That's when I met Jill. Without her I would have been lynched by the mob.~
@5370 = ~I have learned to control it better since then and can decide not to use the power. A few times I have even promised not to do it, but then I get myself into a sticky situation and all promises are forgotten.~
@5371 = ~And that is even without taking into account those aspects of my heritage that I cannot control at all. For example, fire can't touch me like ordinary people and there is nothing I can do about that even if I wanted to.~
@5372 = ~What do you think I should do, <CHARNAME>?~
@5373 = ~There is nothing wrong in using your powers. You and only you can decide how to use them. ~
@5374 = ~That is a tough question and I am not sure I have the answer to it. I am afraid you will have to find the answers yourself, I cannot tell you what to do.~
@5375 = ~I say you should embrace your fiendish background. I see it more as a strength than a weakness. It would be foolish not to wield the powers you are given.~
@5376 = ~I think you should avoid using your demonic powers. They are evil and you know that.~
@5377 = ~Thank you for your opinion, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps I now know you a little better than I did before.~ [m#amb100]
@5378 = ~<CHARNAME>, I never thanked you for coming to my rescue when those slavers captured me. It was very sweet of you, even if it was a bit unnecessary. You are a true friend and I appreciate that.~ [m#amb101]
@5379 = ~A friend and nothing more? I was hoping that we could be more than just friends, Amber.~
@5380 = ~Think nothing of it Amber, it was the least any friend could do. Those slavers make me sick and I would aid anyone captured by them.~
@5381 = ~To tell you the truth, it was a bit tedious - having to come all the way just to save your butt and all for nothing. Friends are useful to have around, but I do not wish to invest too much in them.~
@5382 = ~And I thought I was trying to mend my ways just now.~
@5383 = ~Well, perhaps I should, but I'll have to deal with this first.~
@5384 = ~So, I'll repeat my thanks, <CHARNAME>. You are a better friend than I could hope for.~
@5385 = ~I don't think that you should underestimate friendship. I have never had too many people that I could count on, but I am happy that I can number you among them. (Amber takes your hand and squeezes it gently.)~ [m#amb102]
@5386 = ~Do not get me wrong, Amber. You can count on me, and besides, you are not just *anyone*. I am happy to call you my friend, and would be happier still to call you something more than that. (Bring her hand to your lips for a brief moment.)~
@5387 = ~Amber, you can count on me to look after my friends, including you, but I do not want to give the wrong impression here. I am glad that we are friends, but that is all there is ever going to be.~
@5388 = ~Hey! Keep your hands to yourself. Do not touch me like that! Not without warning.~
@5389 = ~No, I will not think *nothing* of it. I have never had too many people that I could count on, and I would like to count you among them. I just wish that by now you could see me as something more than just 'anyone'. (Amber takes your hand and squeezes it gently.)~ [m#amb103]
@5390 = ~I don't think that you should underestimate friendship. I have never had too many people that I could count on and I would hate to think that you see nothing in me besides utility value.~
@5391 = ~Do not take it personally Amber. I understand the value of friends in a tight spot, but in my position it is just not wise to get too attached to anyone. And besides, I did come after you, didn't I?~
@5392 = ~I saved you this time as I consider you a valuable ally, but I do not want you to get any ideas. The only reason you are still with us is because I know you can pull your load and because you have abilities that we need. Our relationship is strictly business and that is how it is going to stay.~
@5393 = ~Maybe I should not have come after you, after all. If all you are going to do is whine and moralise, you could just as well leave. That is not why I took you with me.~
@5394 = ~If that is what you wish, <CHARNAME>. Let's go on then, as friends.~ [m#amb105]
@5395 = ~Wow, hold it right there! I'm afraid it's you who is getting the wrong impression here. Sorry about that, it just the way it was in the circus; one big family with everyone hugging and taking your hand all the time. I keep forgetting that most people out here are not used to it.~
@5396 = ~Ah, well, I think I overreacted a bit. Just wanted to make sure that there was no misunderstanding of any sort.~
@5397 = ~Okay, umm... I think I could do well without that touching part. Thank you very much.~
@5398 = ~All right... Let's go then, as friends.~
@5399 = ~A bit sensitive, are we? Fine, I can very well do without touching you at all.~
@5400 = ~Well, I trust that you will let me know should you change your mind.~ [m#amb106]
@5401 = ~As I said, I do appreciate your effort. Yet you would do wisely to show more commitment to your friends. Despite the inevitable risk of loss, attachment is not always a liability in times of peril, <CHARNAME>. I hope you will come to see this before it is too late.~
@5402 = ~I suggest that you take some time to think about it and come talk to me later.~
@5403 = ~If that is what you want, that is what you are going to get. Just don't expect anyone to show you true commitment in a tight spot unless you are willing to do the same.~ [m#amb108]
@5404 = ~Well, maybe I should not have come back at all, then. Luckily that mistake is an easy one to correct. I hope that you will learn to treat your remaining companions better before it is too late.~
@5405 = ~(Amber smiles and blushes a little.) Well, I suppose anything is possible.~ [m#amb109]
@5406 = ~Whoa, <CHARNAME>! (Amber pulls her hand away from you.) I think you're getting the wrong idea here. I'm more than glad to be your friend, but that is all. You are a very sweet person, but I'm not interested in anything beyond friendship.~
@5407 = ~Well, if that's all you have to offer... No thanks. I have enough friends as it is.~
@5408 = ~Oh? I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm still glad that we can nevertheless be friends.~
@5409 = ~Heh... I really had you going there for a moment, didn't I? I'm not really interested in you like that - I was just pulling your leg there, friend.~
@5410 = ~Heh... I really had you going there for a moment didn't I? Of course I'm not interested in you like that? What, did you really think I would find you attractive?~
@5411 = ~Well, good for you! It seems that you are not worth my friendship, after all.~ [m#amb110]
@5412 = ~I am happy that you understand, <CHARNAME>. Let's go then, as friends.~ [m#amb111]
@5413 = ~Oh? It was? Well, I suppose that I overreacted.  Let's go then, as friends.~ [m#amb112]
@5414 = ~It is not funny, you know! I think it would be better if you would cut back on those jokes of yours and keep things more formal from now on.~ [m#amb113]
@5415 = ~Whoa, <CHARNAME>! (Amber pulls her hand away from you.) I think you're getting the wrong idea here. I'm more than glad to be your friend, but that is all. I like you <CHARNAME>, I really do, but don't you ever think that I would forget my place.~
@5416 = ~And how do you think it makes me feel when you use me just to humiliate Aerie?~
@5417 = ~And how do you think it makes me feel when you use me just to humiliate Jaheira?~
@5418 = ~And how do you think it makes me feel when you use me just to humiliate Viconia?~
@5419 = ~And how do you think it makes me feel when you use me just to humiliate Solaufein?~
@5420 = ~And how do you think it makes me feel when you use me just to humiliate Kiara?~
@5421 = ~And how do you think it makes me feel when you use me just to humiliate Fade?~
@5422 = ~And how do you think it makes me feel when you use me just to humiliate Saerileth?~
@5423 = ~And how do you think it makes me feel when you use me just to humiliate Tashia?~
@5424 = ~And how do you think it makes me feel when you use me just to humiliate Sime?~
@5425 = ~And how do you think it makes me feel when you use me just to humiliate Nathaniel?~
@5426 = ~There's no way we can ever be more than friends.~
@5427 = ~Besides, I know how you feel about Aerie. And I want you to know that I respect that.~
@5428 = ~Besides, I know how you feel about Jaheira. And I want you to know that I respect that.~
@5429 = ~Besides, I know how you feel about Viconia. And I want you to know that I respect that.~
@5430 = ~Besides, I know how you feel about Solaufein. And I want you to know that I respect that.~
@5431 = ~Besides, I know how you feel about Kiara. And I want you to know that I respect that.~
@5432 = ~Besides, I know how you feel about Fade. And I want you to know that I respect that.~
@5433 = ~Besides, I know how you feel about Saerileth. And I want you to know that I respect that.~
@5434 = ~Besides, I know how you feel about Tashia. And I want you to know that I respect that.~
@5435 = ~Besides, I know how you feel about Sime. And I want you to know that I respect that.~
@5436 = ~Besides, I know how you feel about Nathaniel. And I want you to know that I respect that.~
@5437 = ~So just to be clear about this: there was no hidden agenda of any kind behind my actions.~
@5438 = ~I didn't have much of a choice in that matter. The wizard Irenicus captured us after I had left Baldur’s Gate with <CHARNAME>.~
@5439 = ~Baldur's Gate? That's quite far north from here. It seems that the wizard spared no trouble in seeking you out. I wonder why he's so interested in you two. You certainly don't look all that special to me.~ [m#amb123]
@5440 = ~You might be surprised if you knew the whole truth. And so will the wizard when we catch up with him. Then he will learn not to cross <CHARNAME>. Or me.~
@5441 = ~ You might be surprised if you knew the whole truth. Although I don't really care what the wizard wanted; I just want help <CHARNAME> to find Imoen.~
@5442 = ~I have no idea. Well, I do have some kind of an idea, but the truth of his intentions will remain a mystery until we catch up with him. Then he will learn not to cross <CHARNAME>. Or me.~
@5443 = ~I have no idea. Well, I do have some kind of an idea, but the Cowled Wizards have taken Imoen and I am going to help <CHARNAME> get her back first. I'm not really interested in what the wizard wanted.~
@5444 = ~OK, let me get this straight. The girl and the older wizard were captured by the Cowled Wizards, and now you and <CHARNAME> are after them? Quite a task you have set yourself - the Cowled Ones do not tolerate people mingling in their business.~
@5445 = ~Umm... Maybe I was exaggerating a bit. Truth be told, I did not have much choice in coming to Athkatla. The wizard Irenicus captured me and <CHARNAME> soon after we left Baldur’s Gate.~
@5446 = ~<CHARNAME>, may I ask you something? It's really about our fellow wayfarer, but since you two are such close friends, you might answer it for me.~ [m#amb257]
@5447 = ~If you insist. However, I don't know if it's appropriate for me to discuss <PRO_HISHER> personal life with you.~
@5448 = ~I don't think it is my business to discuss <PRO_HISHER> affairs with you. I think you should ask <CHARNAME> <PRO_HIMHER>self.~
@5449 = ~Whatever you say. As I said, I have no desire to speak to you. You'll be here only as long as <CHARNAME> thinks you are useful, anyway.~
@5450 = ~Well, I guess I'll have to ask <PRO_HIMHER> about it, then. I just thought that asking you might be less awkward.~
@5451 = ~What is <CHARNAME>? <PRO_HESHE> is not all <PRO_RACE>, is <PRO_HESHE>? And don't you give me that look. I have gathered enough from the whispers of the people around you and the looks of the commoners that follow <PRO_HIMHER> when we pass by, to realise that there is more to this party than meets the eye.~ [m#amb278]
@5452 = ~Very well. Have you heard of the prophecies of Alaundo?~
@5453 = ~I really don't know if I should be discussing this with you, Amber. Perhaps you should ask <CHARNAME> <PRO_HIMHER>self.~
@5454 = ~Amber, <PRO_HISHER> heritage is none of your business. Don't bother me with this again.~
@5455 = ~Yes I have. (Amber's almond-shaped eyes widen a bit.) You're not saying that... ...<PRO_HESHE> is one of the children?~
@5456 = ~I was once mistaken for one of <PRO_HISHER> kind. Nearly got me burned at a stake. It seems that my heritage is quite insignificant compared to your friend's.~
@5457 = ~Fine. I guess I'll just have to ask <CHARNAME> about it, then. I just thought that asking you might be less awkward, but I should have guessed it was a bad idea.~
@5458 = ~I would like to thank you for being honest about <CHARNAME> and <PRO_HISHER> lineage - <PRO_HESHE> has done well in trusting your judgement. I guess it would only be fair for me to return the favour. Would you like to hear about my past?~ [m#amb261]
@5459 = ~Spare me from it, will you. I have no interest in you beyond the skills that can help us on our quest.~
@5460 = ~I must admit that I admire your loyalty towards <CHARNAME> in telling me to take my questions directly to <PRO_HIMHER>. I see that <CHARNAME> has done well in trusting you. I respect that and I guess it would only be fair for me to return the favour. Would you like to hear about my past?~ [m#amb263]
@5461 = ~I am sorry that I had to put you in such an uncomfortable situation with regard to <CHARNAME>, but I just had to know. I thank you for your understanding and I guess it would only be fair for me to return the favour. Would you like to hear about my past?~ [m#amb265]
@5462 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME> took you along for your skills, not for your chit chat.~
@5463 = ~On second thought, silence could prove rather uncomfortable in the long run. Could you just come back with your questions at some later time?~
@5464 = ~Though, considering the company you choose to keep... I think you will receive a fair share of suspicion and fear; undoubtedly you have already tasted it.~ [m#amb267]
@5465 = ~You could say that, but let's not talk about <CHARNAME> for a change. I would like to know about you instead.~
@5466 = ~But I grow tired of this conversation, <PLAYER2>. I do not wish to dwell in the past - there are too many painful memories, and even the happy ones have been soured by time.~ [m#amb140]
@5467 = ~Would you have a moment to spare, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb268]
@5468 = ~But of course, Amber. What did you have in mind?~
@5469 = ~If you insist, but be sure to make it brief.~
@5470 = ~Amber, I don't think now is a good time. Perhaps we can talk later?~
@5471 = ~Perhaps we can.~
@5472 = ~I just wanted to know whether you have travelled much before you met <CHARNAME>? I was thinking we could perhaps share some of our experiences?~ [m#amb270]
@5473 = ~Not really. I have known <CHARNAME> since childhood.~
@5474 = ~Not really. I grew up in a little village near Candlekeep, where <CHARNAME> was raised.~
@5475 = ~Not really. I grew up in Baldur's Gate and met <CHARNAME> there.~
@5476 = ~Quite a lot, actually. I did not hook up with <CHARNAME> until recently. You probably know <PRO_HIMHER> just as well as I do.~
@5477 = ~Quite a lot, actually. I had already seen much when I met <CHARNAME>. <PRO_HESHE> had just left Candlekeep when we met.~
@5478 = ~Well, I had already done some travelling on my own, but it wasn't until I met <CHARNAME> that things really started getting interesting.~
@5479 = ~Childhood friends, are you? That is really cute, if you don't mind me saying. You should consider yourself lucky, then.~
@5480 = ~Well, as you have surely already gathered, having <CHARNAME> as a friend can be something of a mixed blessing.~
@5481 = ~I would have to agree. Friends as good as <PRO_HIMHER> are not easy to come by.~
@5482 = ~To be quite frank, having spent so much time with <PRO_HIMHER> sometimes makes me rather tired of <PRO_HISHER> company.~
@5483 = ~I have actually had the same thing said to me. Although Jill always insisted that the trouble I'd often get us into was just a part of the adventure of having me as a friend. I guess it just boils down to the attitude you take to things.~
@5484 = ~Well, yeah. I could say the same about <CHARNAME>; at least I don't be afraid of getting bored.~
@5485 = ~Well, when your life is constantly hanging by a thread just because you happen to be around someone, it can get rather hard to keep a positive attitude.~
@5486 = ~Well, I am yet to make up my mind as to whether teaming up with <CHARNAME> was a good move or not.~
@5487 = ~I could not agree with you more. I guess most people never find a friend who is as close as Jill was to me or <CHARNAME> is to you.~
@5488 = ~Well, I guess I can kind of see your point, but I still don't think you should underestimate the value of true friendship. Most people never find a friend who is as close as Jill was to me or <CHARNAME> obviously is to you.~
@5489 = ~Where did you and <CHARNAME> grow up, then? I have heard <PRO_HIMHER> mention Candlekeep in connection with <PRO_HISHER> past; is that really where you both grew up?~
@5490 = ~Yes, we both grew up in the monastery.~
@5491 = ~No, I actually grew up in a nearby village. <CHARNAME> knew of this window with loose bars through which <PRO_HESHE> used to get out of the monastery so that we could play together.~
@5492 = ~Well, originally I was <PRO_HISHER> imaginary friend, but since <PRO_HESHE> was so determined to believe in me, one day I became real.~
@5493 = ~I have always thought of Candlekeep as a place where old, grumpy sages sit with their noses in the books. Hardly an inspiring place for an adventurous child.~
@5494 = ~Anyway, I know that <CHARNAME> certainly didn't live there with <PRO_HISHER> father, but what about you? Did you live there with your mother or father? Or were you, too, taken in as a foster-child?~
@5495 = ~Actually both my mother and father worked in the monastery. There are other people besides the monks living there, you know.~
@5496 = ~I lived there with my mother, who worked there. Not all the people living there are monks, you know.~
@5497 = ~I lived there with my father. He was not a monk, of course, but he worked for them. There were actually quite a few laymen living in the monastery.~
@5498 = ~My fate was rather similar to that of <CHARNAME>, albeit rather less spectacular. I, too, never knew my real parents, but my foster-father was very much like a real father to me.~
@5499 = ~Well, I used to live in a nearby village with my parents, but when they were both killed by goblins while gathering wood, the monks of Candlekeep took me to live in the monastery.~
@5500 = ~Not the happiest of childhoods, I must admit. But at least you were taken care of. Had you been orphaned in the docks of Waterdeep, your fate would have been quite different.~ [m#amb271]
@5501 = ~So you lived your childhood in the peace of the countryside? I have a hard time imagining what that would have been like.~ [m#amb272]
@5502 = ~You lived in the Gate? You should have some idea of what a city can be like, then. Not that Baldur's Gate would be anywhere near the worse parts of Waterdeep in sheer urban nastiness. But I guess there are similarities - trouble always seems to brew a lot quicker when there are that many people in constant contact with each other.~ [m#amb274]
@5503 = ~An eternity away from the docks of Waterdeep, I would imagine. By the looks of you, I'd say that you have not yet had the pleasure of visiting my hometown. If you ever end up going there, you should watch out though. It can be quite the eye-opener for the uninitiated.~ [m#amb275]
@5504 = ~Perhaps, but considering my skills in getting to know people, I really doubt it.~
@5505 = ~Well, <PRO_HESHE> certainly has the tendency of giving things a stir wherever <PRO_HESHE> goes. Not that I wouldn't know what that's like, though.~
@5506 = ~I take it that you too have seen at least some of the Sword Coast, then. Perhaps then you are not so ignorant as most other people. Maybe you could even cut it in the Dock District of Waterdeep. Or then again, maybe not. Maybe you should give it a try some time.~ [m#amb278]
@5507 = ~Um, right. As tough as my life in the Waterdeep docks sometimes got, I never went quite *that* far to comfort myself.~ [m#amb279]
@5508 = ~If you really don't want to tell me where you grew up, I'll let you keep your little secret.~
@5509 = ~It seems we have both had our share of interesting episodes in our lives. But what about your childhood with <CHARNAME>? I have heard <PRO_HIMHER> mention Candlekeep in connection with <PRO_HISHER> past; is that really where you both grew up?~
@5510 = ~Well, you are still alive. And I bet you would be many an experience poorer were it not for <CHARNAME>. I doubt that anyone would have chosen the kind of childhood I had in the docks of Waterdeep, but in hindsight I cannot avoid seeing the positive things that came out of it.~ [m#amb280]
@5511 = ~Were it not for those experiences, I don't think I would have survived this long. Oftentimes the losses one has to suffer prove to be more valuable than the gains.~ [m#amb281]
@5512 = ~Why do you follow this friend of yours like a some sort of shadow? Or like a pet brought to heel? Wherever <PRO_HESHE> goes, you follow <PRO_HIMHER>.~ [m#amb282]
@5513 = ~One day <PRO_HESHE> will rise to be a power over the Realms. And I will have my share of that power as <PRO_HISHER> loyal servant.~
@5514 = ~We have known each other for a long time and <CHARNAME> is my closest friend. So I guess it is out of love and loyalty that I follow <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@5515 = ~I have made an oath, Amber. An oath to stay by <PRO_HISHER> side, no matter what.~
@5516 = ~Adventuring is a profitable business, Amber. Especially if you're travelling with someone like <CHARNAME>.~
@5517 = ~My reasons are my own and I do not wish to discuss them with you, Amber.~
@5518 = ~I don't think that we have time for this right now. Could you come back later, Amber?~
@5519 = ~And you envision <PRO_HESHE> granting you that share? Would you, were you in <PRO_HISHER> stead? Greed knows not how to share, <CHARNAME>. And talking of sharing, how do you know if <PRO_HESHE> even shares your lust for power?~
@5520 = ~And that in my opinion is about the only good reason to follow anybody, apart from supporting a good cause.  <CHARNAME> is lucky to have such a good friend as you by <PRO_HISHER> side.~
@5521 = ~Oaths are important, and an honest person will keep them, but I would advise you to be cautious. To blindly follow someone who is dishonourable is even more shameful than breaking an oath made to such a person.~
@5522 = ~Oaths are important and an honest person should keep them and not make such a pact lightly. <CHARNAME> is lucky to have as good a friend as you on <PRO_HISHER> side.~
@5523 = ~Well, if fortune and fame are what you are after, you certainly are in the right line of work.~
@5524 = ~However you wish, <CHARNAME>. It would not hurt you to be more open, though.~
@5525 = ~I grant it that <CHARNAME> can be an inspiring leader, especially for one so young. But I would still urge you to be mindful of your motives. I suppose that only time will tell what is to become of <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@5526 = ~And even I must admit that <CHARNAME> is an inspiring leader, especially for one so young. I suppose that only time will tell what is to become of <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@5527 = ~I'll think about that.~
@5528 = ~Life is full of choices, don't you think? Often when I'm faced with a particularly important choice, especially if it's something that I'll have to live with for a long time, I feel that I should never have got up from my bunk in the morning.~ [m#amb283]
@5529 = ~Tell me something, <CHARNAME>. Why did you choose to study magic? What is it that drives you on?~ [m#amb284]
@5530 = ~It's not so much that I chose to study magic - it was the gift that chose me. Whether I like it or not does not really matter.~
@5531 = ~I study to learn. Knowledge is everything.~
@5532 = ~I never believed in the power of steel; only magic can give one the strength to overcome one's enemies.~
@5533 = ~My destiny is entangled with that of <CHARNAME> and other divine powers. I need to be prepared for whatever the future holds in store for me.~
@5534 = ~There is always a choice, <CHARNAME>. At least that's what I believe. Although it is true that not learning to harness your powers might do more damage than putting them to use.~
@5535 = ~I admit that possessing great knowledge can certainly be useful at times, not to mention the joy one can get from learning new things, but it is hardly *everything*.~
@5536 = ~So, it's all about combat and smiting your foes, then? I don't know about you, but at least I would like to think there's more to my life than that.~
@5537 = ~Well, it never hurts to be prepared, but I wouldn't count so much on that destiny business.~
@5538 = ~Tell me something, <CHARNAME>. Why was it that you decided to take up a martial career? Do you believe that combat is the only true path, or is it just by accident that everything always ends up in bloodshed?~ [m#amb285]
@5539 = ~Experience has taught me that it's better to strike first and ask questions later.~
@5540 = ~Well, as you may have noticed, I enjoy witty banter just as much as combat, but talking has never solved my problems - quite the opposite, in fact.~
@5541 = ~Well, I do try to avoid physical conflict whenever possible. It's just that there are always those certain thick-headed individuals with whom you just cannot reason.~
@5542 = ~Look, I really wish I had time to exchange pleasantries with the next monster trying to make me his next dinner, but somehow I don't think I will be given the chance.~
@5543 = ~I do try to talk my way out of most situations, but it just seems that nobody ever listens. Things always seem to get bloody, no matter how much I try to avoid it.~
@5544 = ~Really? You seemed smarter than that.~
@5545 = ~Well, maybe you just aren't as witty as you would like to think, then.~
@5546 = ~Well, I do have to admit that you are right about that.~
@5547 = ~So, I take it that your decision to become a warrior arose out of your miserable failure as a tavern jester? Somehow I'm not surprised.~
@5548 = ~I know the feeling. I guess it has something to do with who's doing the talking...~
@5549 = ~Seems like another talespinner has wandered across my path... Soon I'll have to start doubting that it's just a coincidence. But tell me, <CHARNAME>: have you always had the verse burn in your blood, or did you have to work hard to develop your skills?~ [m#amb286]
@5550 = ~I guess I'm just trying to ask whether it was you who chose to sing the song or the song that chose you to sing it?~
@5551 = ~A talespinner? That wouldn't happen to be a synonym for a liar, would it?  ~
@5552 = ~I've been told that I could play the flute before I could talk, so I suppose that I've always had it in me.~
@5553 = ~Sadly, nothing in this world comes for free, not even to people like me.~
@5554 = ~Well, to be a truly great performer, one has to be born that way, but it still takes constant work to stay this good.~
@5555 = ~No, don't get me wrong, <CHARNAME>. I remember fondly the bards whom I've met in the past. Not that it wouldn't be possible for you to make an exception.~
@5556 = ~At least you are not too shy to admit your own excellence. Comes with the territory, I suppose.~
@5557 = ~Well, I guess that's what makes life interesting, don't you think?~
@5558 = ~And modest to boot. I guess that would at least explain why you never let your tongue rest.~
@5559 = ~So, <CHARNAME>, how did you end up a man of the cloth? Did you know from the beginning that it would be the right path for you?~ [m#amb287]
@5560 = ~No, my path did not dawn upon me until adulthood. But it's better late than never, isn't it?~
@5561 = ~I cannot remember a time before the bond between myself and my deity was forged. Did that answer your question?~
@5562 = ~I didn't really choose my path. Destiny chose it for me, but I am satisfied and honoured nevertheless.~
@5563 = ~My duty is to serve. There are no options.~
@5564 = ~Yeah, I suppose it's never too late to choose a new path.~
@5565 = ~So you have never questioned your calling? Or had doubts? Sounds like an unhealthy relationship.~
@5566 = ~Oh, of course I had questions, but they were all answered. My faith has grown with me.~
@5567 = ~Don't you dare to mock my beliefs! There simply are no questions to be asked or room for doubt!~
@5568 = ~No, there is not a shadow of doubt in my mind, and I don't feel that there would have to be. I am at peace.~
@5569 = ~I'm not sure if I really believe in destiny, but whatever you say.~
@5570 = ~Fair enough , I guess.~
@5571 = ~Calm down, <CHARNAME>. I was merely making an observation from my point of view. Why should you care what others think?~
@5572 = ~I get the impression that you have chosen to interpret the laws of the land rather liberally, much like I myself have been forced to do merely to survive. What would you say was the most daring job you have ever managed to pull off, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb288]
@5573 = ~One time I disposed of the entire dinner party of my target when he was taking another helping of cake - and he didn't notice a thing before he looked up.~
@5574 = ~Well, I once nicked a diamond necklace off a noblewoman - while dancing with her. It would have been a lot easier had her husband not been watching me like a hawk the whole time.~
@5575 = ~I once managed to smuggle a packet of black lotus the size of a human head right under the guards' noses. I told them that it was my prize-winning cabbage straight from the garden.~
@5576 = ~ I don't like to brag about my skills. Not really my style.~
@5577 = ~I do what I must to get by, but I'm not proud of it.~
@5578 = ~And you see that as something to brag about? You should be ashamed of yourself.~
@5579 = ~Well, I bet he was staring you and not the necklace.~
@5580 = ~There are few things more despicable than drug trade. Well, actually only slave trade comes to mind.~
@5581 = ~How modest of you, <CHARNAME>.~
@5582 = ~I know the feeling, <CHARNAME>.~
@5583 = ~<CHARNAME>, I have to admit that your area of expertise is something I myself know very little of. What is it that drives you to serve nature? Why did you choose the path you tread?~ [m#amb289]
@5584 = ~I simply strive to maintain the balance of nature and crush everyone who opposes my goal.~
@5585 = ~I have never been much of a people person; I always got along much better with animals.~
@5586 = ~There is beauty in the quiet song the woodlands. The buzz of towns and the people inhabiting them distracts me from that.~
@5587 = ~Cities and other abominations of man are like sores on the fair face of Faerûn. A plague, truly.~
@5588 = ~There is no hiding from the force of nature. Even as we speak, plants are making their way though the cracks in the stones that houses are built of, and the waves of the ocean are slowly eating away at the stone of the docks.~
@5589 = ~My goal is to create harmony between nature and the people. And that harmony cannot be won through the strength of arms.~
@5590 = ~Sounds like you should work on that anger - find a more balanced approach to things, eh?~
@5591 = ~Well, I could say the same of myself - except that I'm not that familiar with the animal kingdom, either.~
@5592 = ~Well, I would not know anything about that. But perhaps it would not be a bad idea to stop and just listen for a while.~
@5593 = ~And you just kick back and watch that happen? Sounds like an easy enough job to me.~
@5594 = ~There is a seed of wisdom in your words, I give you that.~
@5595 = ~Anyway... It seems that a life of adventuring is a natural choice for a man of your profession. Or what do you think?~
@5596 = ~It does help to make ends meet, yes.~
@5597 = ~I suppose that I could have chosen an easier road, but *easy* has never really been my thing.~
@5598 = ~Money, fame... what more could a man ask for? ~
@5599 = ~In my experience, life on the road is rarely a feast, but at least it's never dull.~ [m#amb290]
@5600 = ~Well, that makes two of us, then.~ [m#amb291]
@5601 = ~A life?~ [m#amb292]
@5602 = ~You never mentioned a word about your parents when talking about your past. What were they like?~ [m#amb293]
@5603 = ~I only ever knew my father, actually. My mother died giving birth to me.~
@5604 = ~Actually I only knew my father properly. He raised me alone after my mother left.~
@5605 = ~I was actually much closer with my father than with my mother. She was always a very distant figure in my life.~
@5606 = ~I only ever knew my mother, actually. My father was killed in an accident when I was only a few months old.~
@5607 = ~Actually I only knew my mother properly. She raised me alone after my father left.~
@5608 = ~I was actually much closer with my mother than with my father. He was always a very distant figure in my life.~
@5609 = ~Well, they were my parents, what else can I say?~
@5610 = ~Well, that would be because I never knew them. They were killed when I was very young.~
@5611 = ~Well, that would be because I never knew them. They abandoned me when I was a child.~
@5612 = ~Well, I don't think that is really any of your business. I like to keep my private matters just that, private.~
@5613 = ~<PLAYER2>, you mentioned that you lived in Candlekeep with your father. How do you remember him?~ [m#amb295]
@5614 = ~How do I remember him? Do you mean what he was like?~
@5615 = ~Very fondly. I learned a lot from him.~
@5616 = ~Well, he never spent very much time with me, but really I can't hold it against him.~
@5617 = ~Better than I would care to. Sometimes I think I would have been better off without him.~
@5618 = ~I do not wish to discuss my father with you. He is no longer a part of my life.~
@5619 = ~I was glad to be rid of him. He never understood anything and was merely trying to hold me back.~
@5620 = ~Well, yes. In your memories, at least. I don't expect you to give an objective view of someone who obviously played an important part in your childhood.~
@5621 = ~I will always remember him with warmth. He taught me much.~
@5622 = ~Well, we were never very close, but I guess it was as much my fault as it was his.~
@5623 = ~Well, I don't think about him very often. I would have to say that I have very few positive memories of him.~
@5624 = ~I really don't think that is something I feel comfortable discussing with you.~
@5625 = ~Your childhood must have been a happy one, then. I have to admit that I really have no idea what it would have been like. I never knew my father, and I never managed to find anyone to replace him; the friends I found were mostly younger than me.~
@5626 = ~I did learn a great deal in the circus, and I think that had I been younger when I joined them, Fabrizio *might* have become something of a father to me. At least that's what I like to believe. But as it happened, I never had anyone like that - a mentor, if you will.~
@5627 = ~Thief You said he taught you much - does that mean that it was because of him you became a thief?~
@5628 = ~Well, he was the shopkeeper in Candlekeep, so I guess you could see some twisted kind of a connection. I guess I just have a slightly different outlook on property rights than he. He was never shy of relieving a foolish customer of his money, though, so I hope that he could at least understand the road I have chosen.~
@5629 = ~Well, he was the shopkeeper in Candlekeep, so I guess you could see some twisted kind of a connection. I guess I just have a slightly different outlook on property rights than he. I don't think he would approve the road I have chosen to travel, though.~
@5630 = ~Well, yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a thief was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@5631 = ~No, he was actually a stablehand at the monastery, but he was a very wise man.~
@5632 = ~No, I couldn't say that he had anything to do with my choice of profession. Which is not to say that I wouldn't have found many of his teachings valuable in what I do.~
@5633 = ~Well, in a way it was. He was one of those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of. It was because of him that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a thief instead.~
@5634 = ~Well, he was a guard at Candlekeep, and it was because of what I saw growing up with him that I swore off a martial career. So I guess it could be said that he had an influence.~
@5635 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a thief instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@5636 = ~Well, he couldn't stop babbling about - and to - all those flowers and herbs growing in the gardens of the monastery. I really didn't share that particular passion of his and decided to devote my time to things more animate than plants.~
@5637 = ~You said he taught you much - does that mean that it was because of him you became a fighter?~
@5638 = ~Yes, I think he was one of the main reasons why pursued a martial career. He worked in the Candlekeep guard, and I always wanted to become a fighter like him. I just found the idea of staying in Candlekeep for the rest of my life rather boring.~
@5639 = ~Well, yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a fighter was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@5640 = ~Well, in a way it was. He was one of those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of. It was because of him that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a fighter instead.~
@5641 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a fighter instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@5642 = ~You said he taught you much - does that mean that it was because of him you became a wizard?~
@5643 = ~Well, he was a mage - albeit a rather bookish one - so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I guess I just had more of the adventurer in me. I hope that he could be still proud of me, though.~
@5644 = ~Well, yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a mage was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@5645 = ~Well, yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a sorcerer was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@5646 = ~You can't choose to become a sorcerer, it's a talent you're born with.~
@5647 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a mage instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@5648 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a sorcerer instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@5649 = ~You said he taught you much - does that mean that it was because of him you became a ranger?~
@5650 = ~Well, he was a naturalist like myself - albeit a more bookish one - so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I guess my interest in nature was just more practical than his. Even though I may never match him in erudition, I hope that he could still be proud of me.~
@5651 = ~Well, yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a ranger was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@5652 = ~Well, in a way it was. He was one of those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of. It was because of him that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a ranger instead.~
@5653 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a ranger instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@5654 = ~You said he taught you much - does that mean that it was because of him you became a druid?~
@5655 = ~Well, yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a druid was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@5656 = ~Well, in a way it was. He was one of those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of. It was because of him that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a druid instead.~
@5657 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a druid instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@5658 = ~You said he taught you much - does that mean that it was because of him you became a cleric?~
@5659 = ~Well, he was a priest in the temple at Candlekeep, so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I just hope that he could be proud of what I have accomplished on my travels.~
@5660 = ~Well, yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a cleric was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@5661 = ~Well, in a way it was. He was one of those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of. It was because of him that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a cleric instead.~
@5662 = ~You said he taught you much - does that mean that it was because of him you became a bard?~
@5663 = ~Well, he did have an interest in music, even if it was more of a theoretical nature.  So I guess it could be said that I took after him. I don't know if he would appreciate my music, though. And I know that he definitely wouldn't appreciate the lifestyle. But I still hope that on some level, he could appreciate what I do.~
@5664 = ~Well, yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a bard was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@5665 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a bard instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@5666 = ~You said he taught you much - does that mean that it was because of him you became a paladin?~
@5667 = ~Well, yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a paladin was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@5668 = ~No, I couldn't say that he had anything to do with my choice of profession. Which is not to say that I wouldn't have found many of his teachings valuable in what I do. ~
@5669 = ~Well, in a way it was. He was one of those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of. It was because of him that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a paladin instead.~
@5670 = ~You said he taught you much - does that mean that it was because of him you became a monk?~
@5671 = ~Well, he was a monk, so yes, it could be said that I took after him. Although I cannot say that he exactly accepted my decision to leave Candlekeep. Even though I may never match him in erudition, I hope that he could still be proud of what I have accomplished.~
@5672 = ~Well, yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a monk was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@5673 = ~Well, in a way it was. He was one of those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of. It was because of him that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a monk  instead.~
@5674 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a monk instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@5675 = ~Well, a negative influence is influence all the same. I don't think you are the first young man ever to rebel against his parents. I guess the influence of *my* parents is just somewhat harder to shake off. Unfortunately.~
@5676 = ~I am sure that he would be proud of you. I think that he would agree with me that his teachings have not gone to waste. You should consider yourself blessed for having had the benefit of his love and wisdom.~
@5677 = ~And that's why you set out adventuring with <CHARNAME> the first chance you got, right? Well, seems that you have done all right up to now - having survived this far. I am sure that your father would be proud of you.~
@5678 = ~Well, I of course never knew your father, but I am sure that he would approve what you have done. You could have turned out much worse.~
@5679 = ~Well, it just seems to be a fact of life that things sometimes don't turn out the way we wish. I'm sure your father would understand that you have your own reasons for what you do.~
@5680 = ~How did you end up as one, then?~
@5681 = ~I guess I just realised at some point that I had a natural affinity to magic.~
@5682 = ~I guess I just found the calling when I grew older. Sometimes life has a way of guiding one towards the true path.~
@5683 = ~When I grew older, I got interested in weapons while watching the local blacksmith at work. I thought of doing that for a living, but I soon found that I liked the finished product more than the process of making it.~
@5684 = ~Well, I guess you could say that when I grew a little older, I found something of a rascal within myself. That, coupled with my nimble fingers, pretty much decided it for me.~
@5685 = ~Well, it was not as if I actually chose my own trade, either. In my case, it could be said that the circumstances were, hmm... rather persuasive. But I guess it's the same with everyone; most of the time we just end up doing what comes naturally in the circumstances we're in. ~
@5686 = ~Well, true wisdom does not always lie in the ivory towers of great wizards or in the temples of the gods. I have met the wisest and most knowledgeable people in the strangest of places, and that's pretty much why I'm here in Amn.~
@5687 = ~And despite all the trouble my stay here has gotten me into, I'm beginning to feel that it might have been worth it.~
@5688 = ~Well, I guess what really counts in life is not learning as such, but the ability to come up with ways of putting what you have learned to the best possible use. I don't think that anyone of us would have survived as long as we have without that ability. As they say, necessity is the mother of invention.~
@5689 = ~I am sure that he has grown to understood your need to reach beyond the walls of the monastery. There are certain things that simply cannot be learned in the library.~
@5690 = ~Why is that?~
@5691 = ~Well, I was not exactly what you'd call an easy child. I guess he kind of just gave up on me and counted on life to teach me its ways. And I guess it has.~
@5692 = ~I guess I was just too interested in everything else to really pay attention to him. I guess it is easy to take something - or someone - for granted if you've never been without.~
@5693 = ~Well, I guess I never gave him a chance to get very close to me. I was already something of a loner when I was a child, and I really didn't tell him much about anything. I guess he just gave up on trying to get me to talk to him.~
@5694 = ~Well, I guess you get what you ask for. Although I don't think that a parent ever totally gives up on his or her children. I'm sure he would be happy to see that you have made it this far.~
@5695 = ~No, I don't think he did. That's why I said I never held it against him.~
@5696 = ~Well, I'm not so sure about it. If he did care, he sure did hide it well. I know that I would have given up on me, had I been in his shoes.~
@5697 = ~As hard as I personally find it to believe that anyone could take having a father for granted, I know exactly what you mean. I guess you never miss something until it's gone. And then it's already too late, of course. Do you ever regret not getting to know your father better?~
@5698 = ~No. I don't believe in regrets. What is done is done, and we just have to live with the consequences.~
@5699 = ~No, I rarely think about him. I guess I might actually miss him more if I had known him better.~
@5700 = ~Well, I have to admit that sometimes I do. There might have been much I could have learned from him. But I guess I'll never know that, will I?~
@5701 = ~Yes, not a day goes by that I do not regret it. If only I had the sense to understand his worth when I was younger.~
@5702 = ~My thoughts exactly. I don't think I could have said it better myself.~
@5703 = ~I guess you have a point there. And in any case, what good have regrets ever done anyone?~
@5704 = ~No you won't. And that's one good reason never to regret your decisions: you can never know what would have happened should you have chosen otherwise.~
@5705 = ~Well, you didn't and no amount of regret is going to change that. You are who you are because of the choices you have made, and it's something you will have to learn to live with.~
@5706 = ~Well, I'll have to admit that nothing much has changed since. But whatever was the case with your father, I'm not going to give up so easily.~
@5707 = ~I'm glad to hear you can appreciate him being there, even if he was distant.~
@5708 = ~Well, I'm glad to hear that you can at least appreciate his position, even if I suspect that you may be underestimating your father's affection.~
@5709 = ~Why is that? Did he treat you badly or did you just not get along with him?~
@5710 = ~Well, having an overzealous guard sergeant for a father is not exactly the recipe for the perfect childhood.~
@5711 = ~I don't think that constantly having to drag your father home from the local tavern because he is too drunk to walk is something you'd really want to be doing when you're ten years old.~
@5712 = ~Oh, I guess apart from the fact that he was mad as a hatter, he was the perfect father.~
@5713 = ~I would rather not talk about it. It's not exactly something I wish to dwell on.~
@5714 = ~Well, as much as I appreciate my freedom, that doesn't sound so bad. If the other option was to have no-one at all to look after you, I'd say most people would go with having your father.~
@5715 = ~Well, if you had met my father, you might think differently.~
@5716 = ~What do you know! You have no idea what it was like.~
@5717 = ~You may be right, of course, but that still doesn't make my childhood experiences any more pleasant.~
@5718 = ~Well, I could always say that had you grown up with no-one looking after you, you might think differently, but that would lead us nowhere. I am sure we both have things in our childhood that we would have liked to change, but obviously we couldn't.~
@5719 = ~I guess I was just trying to point out that there are other sides to the issue and I don't necessarily think you ended up with the shortest of the straws. But then again, I wasn't there, so what would I know.~
@5720 = ~Well, you are right, of course. I was just trying to demonstrate, perhaps rather poorly, that with all probability things could have been even worse. But then again, I guess they always can... ~
@5721 = ~Well, no, unfortunately it doesn't. But I think it is important that you can see beyond your own experiences and understand that there are people for whom your situation would have been an improvement.~
@5722 = ~It is not always easy to see with the eyes of others and to admit that there may be several ways of seeing the same thing, <PLAYER2>. And I just want you to know that it means a lot to me, since that ability - empathy if you will - is pretty much everything that causes people to tolerate people like me.~
@5723 = ~Well, I really cannot disagree with that. But I think that the fact that you did drag him home time after time shows that you found some redeeming qualities in him.~
@5724 = ~Well, I guess it must have been some sort of childish loyalty. After all, he hardly paid any attention to me when he was sober, and when he wasn't he didn't even know who I was and what was it that I wanted with him.~
@5725 = ~I think he was all right when he was sober, although I didn't see him much in that state. Obviously he managed to carry out his duties in the library well enough since they did not kick him out of Candlekeep. Mostly I saw him only in the evenings when I got him home from the tavern and in the mornings when he was grumpy and hung over.~
@5726 = ~Well, I have to admit that there were some good times when he did not drink for months. During those times he actually was like a real father.~
@5727 = ~I really do not wish talk about that.~
@5728 = ~Well, they do say that blood is thicker than water. And I have to say that as much as I'd like to deny it, there is some truth to that old adage. But from what you've told me, I guess it's something you already know.~
@5729 = ~Well, it seems that there are several sides to all of us. It is surprising how well people can hide their less likeable traits when they feel the need to do so. I am sure many of his colleagues didn't think he was that bad; I'm sorry that you had to grow up holding the short end of the stick.~
@5730 = ~Well, at least your memories have a bitter sweetness to them instead of being merely bitter. I don't know if that makes them any easier to forget, however. Probably not.~
@5731 = ~Well, from what I have heard of Candlekeep, I am not surprised to hear your father was eccentric. I really don't think such seclusion from the world can be healthy.~
@5732 = ~If only he had been merely 'eccentric', I would have nothing to complain about. Stark raving mad is what he was! ~
@5733 = ~Well, I think 'eccentric' is putting it rather mildly. I would say that his obsession with arcane learning went beyond mere eccentricity.~
@5734 = ~Well, you are certainly right about the whole place being odd. I guess you could say he was just a bit too well adapted to the place.~
@5735 = ~As much as I would have wanted to know more about your childhood, I can understand that. I will press you no further.~
@5736 = ~If he truly was that mad, why did not his colleagues do something to ease his condition? I would imagine they would have had some means to help him, given all their learning.~
@5737 = ~I don't think they considered him dangerous, and I guess I would have to agree that he was mostly just inconvenient. Spouting a lot of gibberish and ranting about things nobody else understood. I think some of them even thought there was something to his rantings.~
@5738 = ~Well, I guess his ravings made some sense to the sages of Candlekeep, since they seemed to take great interest in them. I think they even wrote much of them down.~
@5739 = ~I don't think there really was anything to be done. I don't know if he had always been like that or if something had happened to him, but they seemed to go to extraordinary lengths to accommodate his madness.~
@5740 = ~I honestly don't know. At times he was even scary, but I don't think his colleagues saw him the same way. I guess he managed to keep his lunacy to himself when outside our home.~
@5741 = ~Hmh. I have also seen what the quest for knowledge can do to people unless tempered by caution and I can well believe that someone like that can be very much incapable of caring about others. But I am glad to see that you turned out all right nevertheless.~
@5742 = ~Hmh. I have also seen what the quest for knowledge can do to people unless tempered by caution and I can well believe that someone like that can be very much incapable of caring about others. I guess I understand you a little better now.~
@5743 = ~I guess that is only to be expected. Who knows what would have come out of you had you not left the place with <CHARNAME>.~
@5744 = ~Who knows, maybe there *was* a method to his madness. They do say that there's but a thin line between madness and genius, and the one may well seem like the other to those uninitiated to the mysteries of the multiverse.~
@5745 = ~I am sure our flighty poet there could have something or other to say on that topic.~
@5746 = ~Well, they must have had their reasons. Maybe they felt guilty or pitied him. Or maybe they just did not want to meddle in the affairs of others - who knows. In any case, what's been has been, and we'll all just have to learn to live with our past.~
@5747 = ~It is unfortunate that those closest to us will often have to pay the highest price for our faults and eccentricities. And it is even more unfortunate that our relatives are the one thing we can never choose.~
@5748 = ~<PLAYER2>, you mentioned that you lived in Candlekeep with your mother. How do you remember her?~ [m#amb296]
@5749 = ~How do I remember her? Do you mean what she was like?~
@5750 = ~Very fondly. I learned a lot from her.~
@5751 = ~Well, she never spent very much time with me, but I really can't hold it against her.~
@5752 = ~Better than I would care to. Sometimes I think I would have been better off without her.~
@5753 = ~I do not wish to discuss my mother with you. She is no longer a part of my life.~
@5754 = ~I was glad to be rid of her. She never understood anything and was merely trying to hold me back.~
@5755 = ~I will always remember her with warmth. She taught me much.~
@5756 = ~Well, we were never very close, but I guess it was as much my fault as it was hers.~
@5757 = ~Well, I don't think about her very often. I would have to say that I have very few positive memories of her.~
@5758 = ~Your childhood must have been a happy one, then. I have to admit that I really have no idea what it would have been like. I never knew my mother, and I never managed to find anyone to replace her; the friends I found were mostly younger than me.~
@5759 = ~I did learn a great deal in the circus, and I think that had I been younger when I joined them, Nadja *might* have become something of a mother to me. At least that's what I like to believe.~

@5761 = ~Well, she was the shopkeeper in Candlekeep, so I guess you could see some twisted kind of a connection. I guess I just have a slightly different outlook on property rights than she. She was never shy of relieving a foolish customer of his money, though, so I hope that she could at least understand the road I have chosen.~
@5762 = ~Well, she was the shopkeeper in Candlekeep, so I guess you could see some twisted kind of a connection. I guess I just have a slightly different outlook on property rights than she. I don't think she would approve the road I have chosen to travel, though.~
@5763 = ~No, she was actually a stablemaid at the monastery, but she was a very wise woman.~
@5764 = ~No, I couldn't say that she had anything to do with my choice of profession. Which is not to say that I wouldn't have found many of her teachings valuable in what I do.~
@5765 = ~Well, in a way it was. She was one of those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of. It was because of her that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a thief instead.~
@5766 = ~Well, she was a guard at Candlekeep, and it was because of what I saw growing up with her that I swore off a martial career. So I guess it could be said that she had an influence.~
@5767 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with her work in the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a thief instead. So I guess she was an influence.~

@5769 = ~You said she taught you much - does that mean that it was because of her you became a fighter?~
@5770 = ~Yes, I think she was one of the main reasons why pursued a martial career. She worked in the Candlekeep guard, and I always wanted to become a fighter like her. I just found the idea of staying in Candlekeep for the rest of my life rather boring.~

@5800 = ~And that's why you set out adventuring with <CHARNAME> the first chance you got, right? Well, seems that you have done all right up to now - having survived this far. I am sure that your mother would be proud of you.~
@5801 = ~Well, I of course never knew your mother, but I am sure that she would approve what you have done. You could have turned out much worse.~
@5802 = ~Well, it just seems to be a fact of life that things sometimes don't turn out the way we wish. I'm sure your mother would understand that you have your own reasons for what you do.~
@5803 = ~I am sure that she has grown to understood your need to reach beyond the walls of the monastery. There are certain things that simply cannot be learned in the library.~
@5804 = ~Well, I was not exactly what you'd call an easy child. I guess she kind of just gave up on me and counted on life to teach me its ways. And I guess it has.~
@5805 = ~I guess I was just too interested in everything else to really pay attention to her. I guess it is easy to take something - or someone - for granted if you've never been without.~
@5806 = ~Well, I guess I never gave her a chance to get very close to me. I was already something of a loner when I was a child, and I really didn't tell her much about anything. I guess she just gave up on trying to get me to talk to her.~
@5807 = ~Well, I guess you get what you ask for. Although I don't think that a parent ever totally gives up on his or her children. I'm sure she would be happy to see that you have made it this far.~
@5808 = ~No, I don't think she did. That's why I said I never held it against her.~
@5809 = ~Well, I'm not so sure about it. If she did care, she sure did hide it well. I know that I would have given up on me, had I been in her shoes.~
@5810 = ~As hard as I personally find it to believe that anyone could take having a mother for granted, I know exactly what you mean. I guess you never miss something until it's gone. And then it's already too late, of course. Do you ever regret not getting to know your mother better?~
@5811 = ~No, I rarely think about her. I guess I might actually miss her more if I had known her better.~
@5812 = ~Well, I have to admit that sometimes I do. There might have been much I could have learned from her. But I guess I'll never know that, will I?~
@5813 = ~Yes, not a day goes by that I do not regret it. If only I had the sense to understand her worth when I was younger.~
@5814 = ~Well, I'll have to admit that nothing much has changed since. But whatever was the case with your mother, I'm not going to give up so easily.~
@5815 = ~I'm glad to hear you can appreciate her being there, even if she was distant.~
@5816 = ~Well, I'm glad to hear that you can at least appreciate her position, even if I suspect that you may be underestimating your mother's affection.~
@5817 = ~Why is that? Did she treat you badly or did you just not get along with her?~
@5818 = ~Well, having a tyrant of a schoolmistress for a mother is not exactly the recipe for the perfect childhood.~
@5819 = ~I don't think that constantly having to drag your mother home from the local tavern because she is too drunk to walk is something you'd really want to be doing when you're ten years old.~
@5820 = ~Oh, I guess apart from the fact that she was mad as a hatter, she was the perfect mother.~
@5821 = ~Well, as much as I appreciate my freedom, that doesn't sound so bad. If the other option was to have no-one at all to look after you, I'd say most people would go with having your mother.~
@5822 = ~Well, if you had met my mother, you might think differently.~
@5823 = ~Well, I really cannot disagree with that. But I think that the fact that you did drag her home time after time shows that you found some redeeming qualities in her.~
@5824 = ~Well, I guess it must have been some sort of childish loyalty. After all, she hardly paid any attention to me when she was sober, and when she wasn't she didn't even know who I was and what was it that I wanted with her.~
@5825 = ~I think she was all right when she was sober, although I didn't see her much in that state. Obviously she managed to carry out her duties in the library well enough since they did not kick her out of Candlekeep. Mostly I saw her only in the evenings when I got her home from the tavern and in the mornings when she was grumpy and hung over.~
@5826 = ~Well, I have to admit that there were some good times when she did not drink for months. During those times she actually was like a real mother.~
@5827 = ~Well, it seems that there are several sides to all of us. It is surprising how well people can hide their less likeable traits when they feel the need to do so. I am sure many of her colleagues didn't think she was that bad; I'm sorry that you had to grow up holding the short end of the stick.~
@5828 = ~Well, from what I have heard of Candlekeep, I am not surprised to hear your mother was eccentric. I really don't think such seclusion from the world can be healthy.~
@5829 = ~If only she had been merely 'eccentric', I would have nothing to complain about. Stark raving mad is what she was!~
@5830 = ~Well, I think 'eccentric' is putting it rather mildly. I would say that her obsession with arcane learning went beyond mere eccentricity.~
@5831 = ~Well, you are certainly right about the whole place being odd. I guess you could say she was just a bit too well adapted to the place.~
@5832 = ~If she truly was that mad, why did not her colleagues do something to ease her condition? I would imagine they would have had some means to help her, given all their learning.~
@5833 = ~I don't think they considered her dangerous, and I guess I would have to agree that she was mostly just inconvenient. Spouting a lot of gibberish and ranting about things nobody else understood. I think some of them even thought there was something to her rantings.~
@5834 = ~Well, I guess her ravings made some sense to the sages of Candlekeep, since they seemed to take great interest in them. I think they even wrote much of them down.~
@5835 = ~I don't think there really was anything to be done. I don't know if she had always been like that or if something had happened to her, but they seemed to go to extraordinary lengths to accommodate her madness.~
@5836 = ~I honestly don't know. At times she was even scary, but I don't think her colleagues saw her the same way. I guess she managed to keep her lunacy to herself when outside our home.~
@5837 = ~Who knows, maybe there *was* a method to her madness. They do say that there's but a thin line between madness and genius, and the one may well seem like the other to those uninitiated to the mysteries of the multiverse.~
@5838 = ~Well, they must have had their reasons. Maybe they felt guilty or pitied her. Or maybe they just did not want to meddle in the affairs of others - who knows. In any case, what's been has been, and we'll all just have to learn to live with our past.~
@5839 = ~<PLAYER2>, you mentioned that you lived in Candlekeep with your parents. How do you remember them?~ [m#amb297]
@5840 = ~How do I remember them? Do you mean what they were like?~
@5841 = ~Very fondly. I learned a lot from them.~
@5842 = ~Well, they never spent very much time with me, but I really can't hold it against them.~
@5843 = ~Better than I would care to. Sometimes I think I would have been better off without them.~
@5844 = ~I do not wish to discuss my parents with you. They are no longer a part of my life.~
@5845 = ~I was glad to be rid of them. They never understood anything and were merely trying to hold me back.~
@5846 = ~Well, yes. In your memories, at least. I don't expect you to give an objective view of people who obviously played an important part in your childhood.~
@5847 = ~I will always remember them with warmth. They taught me much.~
@5848 = ~Well, we were never very close, but I guess it was as much my fault as it was theirs.~
@5849 = ~Well, I don't think about them very often. I would have to say that I have very few positive memories of them.~
@5850 = ~Your childhood must have been a happy one, then. I have to admit that I really have no idea what it would have been like. I never knew either of my parents, and I never managed to find anyone to replace them; the few friends I found were mostly younger than me.~
@5851 = ~I did learn a great deal in the circus, and I think that had I been younger when I joined them, I *might* have come to view Fabrizio or Nadja as a surrogate father or mother. At least that's what I like to believe. But as it happened, I never had anything resembling parents.~
@5852 = ~You said they taught you much - does that mean that it was because of them you became a thief?~
@5853 = ~Well, my parents were the shopkeepers in Candlekeep, so I guess you could see some twisted kind of a connection. I guess I just have a slightly different outlook on property rights than they did. They were never shy of relieving a foolish customer of his money, though, so I hope that they could at least understand the road I have chosen.~
@5854 = ~Well, my parents were the shopkeepers in Candlekeep, so I guess you could see some twisted kind of a connection. I guess I just have a slightly different outlook on property rights than they did. I don't think they would approve the road I have chosen to travel, though.~
@5855 = ~No, my father was actually a stablehand and my mother a scullery maid at the monastery, but they were both very wise people.~
@5856 = ~No, I couldn't say that they had anything to do with my choice of profession. Which is not to say that I wouldn't have found many of their teachings valuable in what I do.~
@5857 = ~Well, in a way it was. My parents were a pair of those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of. It was because of them that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a thief instead.~
@5858 = ~Well, my father was a guard at Candlekeep, and it was because of what I saw growing up with him that I swore off a martial career. So I guess it could be said that he had an influence.~
@5859 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with my mother's work in the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a thief instead. So I guess she was an influence.~
@5860 = ~Well, they couldn't stop babbling about - and to - all those flowers and herbs growing in the gardens of the monastery. I really didn't share that particular passion of theirs and decided to devote my time to things more animate than plants.~

@5916 = ~Why would they have believed me? I was just a child and my father was a respected scholar. He would have just beaten us both for trying to embarrass him.~
@5917 = ~And get us all thrown out of Candlekeep? That would have made my father real happy. He would probably have killed both of us for that.~
@5918 = ~It wasn't that bad all the time. I guess I just kept hoping that things would turn to better like he always kept saying afterwards.~
@5919 = ~Well, you could at least have tried. It may well have turned out as you said, but on the other hand it may have not. Sometimes you'll just have to take the risk if you want to make a difference.~

@5921 = ~You may be right, but it's a bit too late for regrets, isn't it.~

@5932 = ~Well, I guess their ravings made some sense to the sages of Candlekeep, since they seemed to take great interest in them. I think they even wrote much of it down.~
@5933 = ~I don't think there really was anything to be done. I don't know if they had always been like that or if something had happened to them, but their colleagues seemed to go to extraordinary lengths to accommodate their madness.~
@5934 = ~I honestly don't know. At times they were even scary, but I don't think their colleagues saw them the same way. I guess they managed to keep their lunacy to themselves when outside our home.~
@5935 = ~Who knows, maybe there *was* a method to their madness. They do say that there's but a thin line between madness and genius, and the one may well seem like the other to those uninitiated to the mysteries of the multiverse.~
@5936 = ~Well, they must have had their reasons. Maybe they felt guilty or pitied them. Or maybe they just did not want to meddle in the affairs of others - who knows. In any case, what's been has been, and we'll just have to learn to live with our past.~
@5937 = ~<PLAYER2>, you mentioned that you lived your childhood in Candlekeep with the monks. How do you remember that time?~ [m#amb298]
@5938 = ~How do I remember it? Do you mean what was it like?~
@5939 = ~Very fondly. I learned a lot from the wisdom of the monks.~
@5940 = ~Better than I would care to. Sometimes I think I would have been better off anywhere else.~
@5941 = ~I do not wish to discuss my childhood with you. It is in the past.~
@5942 = ~I was glad to be rid of that place. They never understood anything there, and the monks were merely trying to hold me back.~
@5943 = ~I will always remember that period of my life with warmth. They taught me much.~
@5944 = ~Well, I never felt that I belonged there, but I guess it was as much my fault as it was theirs.~
@5945 = ~Well, I don't think about that time very often. I would have to say that I have very few positive memories of it.~
@5946 = ~Your childhood must have been a happy one, then. I have to admit that I really have no idea what it would have been like. I never had anyone look after me when I was a child; the few friends I found were mostly younger than me.~
@5947 = ~I did learn a great deal in the circus and I guess I did view Nadja and Fabrizio as something like my mentors, albeit more in the professional than in the personal sense. Many times I wished I had met them when I was younger and really needed someone to guide me. I guess an adult to lean on would have made the world a lot less scary and overwhelming.~
@5948 = ~But that's enough of me. You said the monks taught you much - does that mean that it was because of growing up in Candlekeep that you became a thief?~
@5949 = ~Well, I did spend much of my childhood apprenticed at the shop there, so I guess you could see some twisted kind of a connection. I guess I just have a slightly different outlook on property rights than my masters. They were never shy of relieving a foolish customer of his money, though, so I hope that they could at least understand the road I have chosen.~
@5950 = ~Well, I did spend much of my childhood apprenticed at the shop there, so I guess you could see some twisted kind of a connection. I guess I just have a slightly different outlook on property rights than my master did. I don't think he would approve the road I have chosen to travel, though.~
@5951 = ~Well, in a way it was. I was always surrounded by those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of when I was growing up. It was because of them that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a thief instead.~
@5952 = ~Well, I could say that it was because of what I saw growing up around the guards of Candlekeep that I swore off a martial career. So I guess it could be said that it had an influence.~
@5953 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a thief instead. So I guess it was an influence.~
@5954 = ~But that's enough of me. You said the monks taught you much - does that mean that it was because of growing up in Candlekeep that you became a fighter?~
@5955 = ~Yes, I think growing up in Candlekeep was one of the main reasons why I pursued a martial career. I always admired the Candlekeep guard, and always wanted to become like them. It was only when I grew older that I came to find Candlekeep a bit too confining.~
@5956 = ~Well, in a way it was. I was always surrounded by those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of when I was growing up. It was because of them that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a fighter instead.~
@5957 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a fighter instead. So I guess it was an influence.~
@5958 = ~But that's enough of me. You said the monks taught you much - does that mean that it was because of growing up in Candlekeep that you became a wizard?~
@5959 = ~Well, I did always look up to the scholar mages of Candlekeep. I guess I just had more of the adventurer in me. I hope that my tutors could still proud of me, though.~
@5960 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a mage instead. So I guess it was an influence.~
@5961 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a sorcerer instead. So I guess it was an influence.~
@5962 = ~But that's enough of me. You said the monks taught you much - does that mean that it was because of growing up in Candlekeep that you became a ranger?~
@5963 = ~Well, the gardens - as far from the wilderness they were - always intrigued me, so I guess you could see an influence. Although I learned a lot from the gardeners and botanists of Candlekeep, I was always more interested in the *real* nature, out there.~
@5964 = ~Well, in a way it was. I was always surrounded by those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of when I was growing up. It was because of them that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a ranger instead.~
@5965 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a ranger instead. So I guess it was an influence.~
@5966 = ~But that's enough of me. You said the monks taught you much - does that mean that it was because of growing up in Candlekeep that you became a druid?~
@5967 = ~Well, in a way it was. I was always surrounded by those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of when I was growing up. It was because of them that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a druid instead.~
@5968 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a druid instead. So I guess it was an influence.~
@5969 = ~But that's enough of me. You said the monks taught you much - does that mean that it was because of growing up in Candlekeep that you became a cleric?~
@5970 = ~Yes, I spent a good deal of my youth in the Temple of Oghma. Although I left Candlekeep behind me in order to see the word and learn new things, I am still walking that same road along which I walked out of the temple gates.~
@5971 = ~Well, in a way it was. I was always surrounded by those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of when I was growing up. It was because of them that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a cleric instead.~
@5972 = ~But that's enough of me. You said the monks taught you much - does that mean that it was because of growing up in Candlekeep that you became a bard?~
@5973 = ~Well, I did grow up surrounded by the singing of the Chanter and the Voices. I don't know if they would appreciate my music, though. And I know that they definitely wouldn't appreciate the lifestyle. But I still hope that on some level, they could appreciate what I do.~
@5974 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a bard instead. So I guess it was an influence.~
@5975 = ~But that's enough of me. You said the monks taught you much - does that mean that it was because of growing up in Candlekeep that you became a paladin?~
@5976 = ~Well, in a way it was. I was always surrounded by those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of when I was growing up. It was because of them that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a paladin instead.~
@5977 = ~But that's enough of me. You said the monks taught you much - does that mean that it was because of growing up in Candlekeep that you became a monk?~
@5978 = ~Well, I *did* grow up surrounded by monks, so you could say that there is a connection. Although I cannot say that my superiors exactly accepted my decision to leave Candlekeep. Even though I may never match them in erudition, I hope that they could somehow be proud of what I have accomplished.~
@5979 = ~Well, in a way it was. I was always surrounded by those stuffy wizards that Candlekeep was full of when I was growing up. It was because of them that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a monk instead.~
@5980 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with the temple at Candlekeep, that I decided to keep away from the gods and become a monk instead. So I guess it was an influence.~
@5981 = ~Well, a negative influence is influence all the same. I don't think you are the first young man ever to rebel against his guardians. I guess my heritage is just somewhat harder to shake off. Unfortunately.~
@5982 = ~And that's why you set out adventuring with <CHARNAME> the first chance you got, right? Well, seems that you have done all right up to now - having survived this far. I am sure that the Candlekeep guard would be proud of you.~
@5983 = ~Well, I of course never knew any of your masters, but I am sure that they would approve what you have done. You could have turned out much worse.~
@5984 = ~Well, it just seems to be a fact of life that things sometimes don't turn out the way we wish. I'm sure your masters would understand that you have your own reasons for what you do.~
@5985 = ~Well, I guess you get what you ask for. Although I don't think that guardians ever totally give up on their wards. I'm sure they would be happy to see that you have made it this far.~
@5986 = ~As hard as I personally find it to believe that anyone could take having a guardian or a mentor for granted, I know exactly what you mean. I guess you never miss something until it's gone. And then it's already too late, of course. Do you ever regret not getting to know your guardians better?~
@5987 = ~Well, I'll have to admit that nothing much has changed since. But whatever was the case with your guardians, I'm not going to give up so easily.~
@5988 = ~Well, I'm glad to hear that you can at least appreciate their position, even if I suspect that you may be underestimating their affection.~
@5989 = ~I guess I just never adapted to the monastery, and they treated me accordingly. And I can tell you that those monks sure believed in discipline.~
@5990 = ~Well, I can tell you that those monks can be much more sadistic than most people realise.~
@5991 = ~I think that our outlooks on life were just too different. I don't think it was too enjoyable for either side.~
@5992 = ~Well, I guess that's more or less the core of their philosophy, so I can't say I'm surprised you didn't fit in.~
@5993 = ~Well, I have no difficulty believing you, although I must admit that I have no personal experience. I have made it my business to keep out of the way of all brands of religious or ideological zealots.~
@5994 = ~Well, maybe it did both of you some good - having to learn to tolerate each other at least to some degree.~
@5995 = ~<PLAYER2>, you mentioned that you were raised in Candlekeep by a foster father. I understood that you were happy with him.~ [m#amb299]
@5996 = ~Well, I guess he was kind enough. I never had any problems with him. Not that I ever grew to know him that well.~
@5997 = ~He was like a father to me. He took a good care of me and  I learned a lot from him.~
@5998 = ~I really don't think that is something I feel comfortable discussing with you, Amber.~
@5999 = ~Well, at least that is something we have in common. Did you have someone take care of you or did you grow up on your own?~
@6000 = ~Well, it's not really possible to grow up on your own in a small rural village. I was taken in by an older man who had no children of his own.~
@6001 = ~Yeah, I grew up pretty much on my own in Baldur's Gate. There were a bunch of us, though, so I was never really alone.~
@6002 = ~Well, I was found by the city guard when I was a little baby and placed in the custody of a local widower. At least that's what I've been told by my foster father.~
@6003 = ~Well, yes. My foster father told me that he found me left on his doorstep when I was but a wee baby. He decided to take me in and took care of me till adulthood.~
@6004 = ~No, I have been on my own as long as I can remember.~
@6005 = ~So you were not that bad off in the end. How did you like your foster father?~
@6006 = ~I did not get along with him that well. He was a mean old man and I left him as soon as I was old enough to set on my own.~
@6007 = ~Well, I guess that was better than having to make it on your own. The world can be a scary place when you are just a child. Sometimes I wish that I had somehow found my way to the circus already when I was a child.~
@6008 = ~Seeing as how they took care of all the children among them, I cannot help thinking that my childhood could have been a lot less unpleasant than it turned out to be. But I guess I should just consider myself lucky that I met those people at all.~
@6009 = ~But enough of me. Do you know whether your foster-father is still alive?~
@6010 = ~I doubt it; he was already old when I left, and that was many years ago.~
@6011 = ~I hope so. Though he was already old when I left, and that was many years ago.~
@6012 = ~There shouldn't be any reason for him not to be. He wasn't that old when I left.~
@6013 = ~Well, if we ever end up in your old neighbourhood, we could find out, couldn't we?~
@6014 = ~Well, if we ever make it through all this, I guess we could.~
@6015 = ~No, the life I lived with him is long gone. I don't think I will ever return there.~
@6016 = ~Maybe. I guess we'll first have to see where the road takes us, though.~
@6017 = ~So, when this all is over, I will make sure to hold you to your word. But right now I think we'd better get going before <CHARNAME> gets impatient with us.~
@6018 = ~I really can't blame you for not wanting to return there, having burned my share of bridges behind me in the past. Let's just say that I understand you. But right now I think we'd better get going before <CHARNAME> gets impatient with us.~
@6019 = ~I suppose you are right. We are not really in a position to make plans for the future. But right now I think we'd better get going before <CHARNAME> gets impatient with us.~
@6020 = ~Your childhood must have been a happy one, then. I have to admit that I really have no idea what it would have been like.~
@6021 = ~I never had anyone like that - the friends I found were mostly younger than me, and although I did learn a great deal in the circus and at times it almost felt like being a part of a family, I never had anyone like that - a mentor, if you will.~
@6022 = ~Was he also a thief, like yourself?~
@6023 = ~Yes, and I think he was the main reason why I became one. I always wanted to be like him. I only hope I have not let him down.~
@6024 = ~Well, he was a thief by trade, so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I just hope that he could be proud of me, if he saw me now.~
@6025 = ~Yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a thief was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@6026 = ~No, he was actually a shepherd, but he was a very wise man.~
@6027 = ~No, he was actually a merchant, but he knew a lot about the workings of the world.~
@6028 = ~Was he also a fighter, like yourself?~
@6029 = ~Well, he was a fighter by trade, so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I just hope that he could be proud of me, if he saw me now.~
@6030 = ~Yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a fighter was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@6031 = ~Was he also a wizard, like yourself?~
@6032 = ~Well, he was a wizard, so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I just hope that he could be proud of me, if he saw me now.~
@6033 = ~Yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a mage was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@6034 = ~Yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a sorcerer was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@6035 = ~Was he also a ranger, like yourself?~
@6036 = ~Well, he was a ranger like myself, so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I just hope that he could be proud of me, if he saw me now.~
@6037 = ~Yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a ranger was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@6038 = ~Was he also a druid, like yourself?~
@6039 = ~Well, he was a druid like myself, so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I just hope that he could be proud of me, if he saw me now.~
@6040 = ~Yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a druid was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@6041 = ~Was he also a cleric, like yourself?~
@6042 = ~Well, he was a cleric, so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I just hope that he could be proud of me, if he saw me now.~
@6043 = ~Yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a cleric was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@6044 = ~Was he also a bard, like yourself?~
@6045 = ~Well, he did have something of the minstrel in him, so I guess you could say that I took after him. I just hope that he could be proud of me, if he saw me now.~
@6046 = ~Yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a bard was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@6047 = ~Was he also a paladin, like yourself?~
@6048 = ~Well, he was a member of the Order, so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I just hope that he could be proud of me, if he saw me now.~
@6049 = ~Yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a paladin was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@6050 = ~Was he also a monk, like yourself?~
@6051 = ~Well, he was a monk, so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I just hope that he could be proud of me, if he saw me now.~
@6052 = ~Yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a monk was the last thing I wanted to become.~
@6053 = ~I am sure that he would be proud of you. I think that he would agree with me that his teachings have not gone to waste.~
@6054 = ~And that's when you set out adventuring, right? I guess that being on your own beats being around someone you don't like. And at least he got you through your childhood alive. And hey, seems like you turned out almost all right.~
@6055 = ~Well, it was not as if I actually chose my own trade, either. In my case, it could be said that the circumstances were, hmm... rather persuasive. But I guess it's the same with everyone; most of the time we just end up doing what comes naturally in the circumstances we're in.~
@6056 = ~Well, at least you didn't lose both of them.  Tell me about your father. How do you remember him?~
@6057 = ~You said he taught you much - does that mean that it was because of him you became a thief?~
@6058 = ~Well, he was a merchant, so I guess you could see some twisted kind of a connection. I guess I just have a slightly different outlook on property rights than he. He was never shy of relieving a foolish customer of his money, though, so I hope that he could at least understand the road I have chosen.~
@6059 = ~Well, he was a merchant, so I guess you could see some twisted kind of a connection. I guess I just have a slightly different outlook on property rights than he. I don't think he would approve the road I have chosen to travel, though.~
@6060 = ~No, he was actually a stablehand at a tavern in Beregost, but he was a very wise man.~
@6061 = ~No, he was actually a stablehand at the village tavern, but he was a very wise man.~
@6062 = ~No, he was actually a stablehand at a tavern in Baldur's Gate, but he was a very wise man.~
@6063 = ~Well, in a way it was. He was one of those stuffy wizards locked away in his chamber. It was because of him that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a thief instead.~
@6064 = ~Well, he was a member of the Flaming Fist in Baldur's Gate, and it was because of what I saw growing up with him that I swore off a martial career. So I guess it could be said that he had an influence.~
@6065 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a thief instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@6066 = ~Well, he couldn't stop babbling about - and to - all those flowers and herbs he was growing. I really didn't share that particular passion of his and decided to devote my time to things more animate than plants.~
@6067 = ~Yes, I think he was one of the main reasons why I pursued a martial career. He was a member of the Flaming Fist at Baldur's Gate, and I always wanted to become a fighter like him. I just found the idea of following orders for the rest of my life rather boring.~
@6068 = ~Well, in a way it was. He was one of those stuffy wizards locked away in his chamber. It was because of him that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a fighter instead.~
@6069 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a fighter instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@6070 = ~Well, he was a wizard - well, more like a scholar of the arcane, actually - so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I guess I just had more of the adventurer in me. I hope that he could be still proud of me, though.~
@6071 = ~Well, yes. It is rather ironic that when I was a child, a mage was the last thing I wanted to become. ~
@6072 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a mage instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@6073 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a sorcerer instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@6074 = ~Well, he was a naturalist like myself, even though he was a real bookworm and not much of an outdoorsman. So yes, it could be said that I took after him. I guess my interest in nature was just more practical than his. Even though I may never match him in erudition, I hope that he could still be proud of me.~
@6075 = ~Yes, I learned most of what I know about nature from my father. Most important of all, he taught me how to listen to it; it's not about how much you know, but how much you can hear nature tell you.~
@6076 = ~Well, in a way it was. He was one of those stuffy wizards locked away in his chamber. It was because of him that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a ranger instead.~
@6077 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a ranger instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@6078 = ~Well, in a way it was. He was one of those stuffy wizards locked away in his chamber. It was because of him that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a druid instead.~
@6079 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a druid instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@6080 = ~Well, he was a priest, so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I just hope that he could be proud of what I have accomplished on my travels.~
@6081 = ~Well, in a way it was. He was one of those stuffy wizards locked away in his chamber. It was because of him that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a cleric instead.~
@6082 = ~Well, he did have an interest in music, even if it was of a rather different type of music. He was a composer at the ducal court, you see. So I guess it could be said that I took after him. I don't know if he would appreciate my music, though. And I know that he definitely wouldn't appreciate the lifestyle. But I still hope that on some level, he could appreciate what I do.~
@6083 = ~Well, considering that he was a member of the theatrical troupe I grew up in, I would have to say that yes, he had an effect. I don't really think I ever considered becoming anything else than a performer. I just hope my father would understand why I didn't stay with the company. I just felt I needed to find my own way.~
@6084 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a bard instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@6085 = ~Well, he was a priest, so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I just hope that he could be proud of what I have accomplished on my travels~
@6086 = ~Well, in a way it was. He was one of those stuffy wizards locked away in his chamber. It was because of him that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a paladin instead.~
@6087 = ~Well, he was a traveling monk, so yes, it could be said that I took after him. I have to say that I am proud to walk in his footsteps, and I hope I can take his teachings to places he never had the time to reach.~
@6088 = ~Well, in a way it was. He was one of those stuffy wizards locked away in his chamber. It was because of him that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a monk instead.~
@6089 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with his work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a monk instead. So I guess he was an influence.~
@6090 = ~Well, he wouldn't have been much of an artist if he hadn't understood, would he? It doesn't really matter if you view performing as an art or a craft, in either case you will have to find your own way of doing it. Not that I see anything wrong in carrying on the tradition as it has always been, but even then, you'd have to feel that it's what you want to do, wouldn't you?~
@6091 = ~Yes, I think you are right. I believe he did understand.~
@6092 = ~Well, I hope you are right. I would hate for him to think that I didn't value his teachings.~
@6093 = ~It is not hard to see that his teachings have fallen on a fertile ground, so to speak. You should consider yourself blessed for having had the benefit of his love and wisdom.~
@6094 = ~And that's why you set out adventuring the first chance you got, right? Well, seems that you have done all right up to now - having survived this far. And considering who you've been travelling with, that is no mean feat. I am sure that your father would be proud of you.~
@6095 = ~Why is that? Did he treat you badly or did you just not along with him?~
@6096 = ~Well, having an overzealous Flaming Fist sergeant for a father is not exactly the recipe for the perfect childhood.~
@6097 = ~I think he was all right when he was sober, although I didn't see him much in that state. Obviously he managed to carry out his job well enough since he managed to keep it. Mostly I saw him only in the evenings when I got him home from the tavern and in the mornings when he was grumpy and hung over.~
@6098 = ~Well, judging from the selection of people I have met on my travels, I could say that most people if not all have their own eccentricities. Although it is true that there are those few select people who are somewhat more eccentric than their neighbours.~
@6099 = ~If only he had been merely 'eccentric', I would have nothing to complain about. Stark raving mad is what he was!~
@6100 = ~I'd say that my father would easily qualify as one of those select few. At least he was definitely more eccentric than our neighbours. Any of them.~
@6101 = ~If he truly was that mad, why didn't anyone try to do something to ease his condition?~
@6102 = ~Well, we took him to the village healer who tried, but apparently there was nothing she could do. Couldn't even figure out what was wrong with him.~
@6103 = ~Most of the wizards, sages and healers in Baldur's Gate had a look at him at one time or another, but no-one could really do anything. That it wasn't a magical thing was all they could tell.~
@6104 = ~I don't think there really was anything to be done. I don't know if he had always been like that or if something had happened to him, but everyone seemed to go to extraordinary lengths to accommodate his madness.~
@6105 = ~I honestly don't know. At times he was even scary, but I don't think most people saw him the same way. I guess he managed to keep his lunacy to himself when outside our home.~
@6106 = ~Well, although your childhood probably was a bit harder than that of your neighbours, it was probably also more interesting. I'd think you would have been a lot less prepared for the uncertainty of adventuring had you lived a more 'normal' childhood.~
@6107 = ~Well, that is unfortunate, at least for you. As for him, I guess you - or anyone else save for himself for that matter - can never know what went through his head and whether he had enough sense to suffer from it. At least you tried to help him.~
@6108 = ~Well, they must have had their reasons. Maybe they knew more of his affliction than anyone told you. Perhaps his friends and family even felt guilty or pitied him. Or maybe they just did not want to meddle in his affairs - who knows. In any case, what's been has been, and we'll all just have to learn to live with our past.~
@6109 = ~Well, at least you didn't lose both of them.  Tell me about your mother. How do you remember her?~
@6110 = ~Well, at least you had the chance to know one of them. Tell me about your mother. How do you remember her?~
@6111 = ~Well, she was a merchant, so I guess you could see some twisted kind of a connection. I guess I just have a slightly different outlook on property rights than she. She was never shy of relieving a foolish customer of his money, though, so I hope that she could at least understand the road I have chosen.~
@6112 = ~Well, she was a merchant, so I guess you could see some twisted kind of a connection. I guess I just have a slightly different outlook on property rights than she. I don't think she would approve the road I have chosen to travel, though.~
@6113 = ~No, she was actually a stablemaid at a tavern in Beregost, but she was a very wise woman.~
@6114 = ~No, she was actually a stablemaid at the village tavern, but she was a very wise woman.~
@6115 = ~No, she was actually a stablemaid at a tavern in Baldur's Gate, but she was a very wise woman.~
@6116 = ~Well, in a way it was. She was one of those stuffy wizards locked away in her chamber. It was because of her that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a thief instead.~
@6117 = ~Well, she was one of the few women in the Flaming Fist in Baldur's Gate, and it was because of what I saw growing up with her that I swore off a martial career. So I guess it could be said that she had an influence.~
@6118 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with her work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a thief instead. So I guess she was an influence.~
@6119 = ~Well, she couldn't stop babbling about - and to - all those flowers and herbs she was growing. I really didn't share that particular passion of hers and decided to devote my time to things more animate than plants.~
@6120 = ~Yes, I think she was one of the main reasons why I pursued a martial career. She was one of the few women in the Flaming Fist at Baldur's Gate, and I always wanted to become a fighter like her. I just found the idea of following orders for the rest of my life rather boring.~
@6121 = ~Well, in a way it was. She was one of those stuffy wizards locked away in her chamber. It was because of her that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a fighter instead.~
@6122 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with her work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a fighter instead. So I guess she was an influence.~
@6123 = ~Well, she was a wizard - well, more like a scholar of the arcane, actually - so yes, it could be said that I took after her. I guess I just had more of the adventurer in me. I hope that she could be still proud of me, though.~
@6124 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with her work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a mage instead. So I guess she was an influence.~
@6125 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with her work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a sorcerer instead. So I guess she was an influence.~
@6126 = ~Well, she was a naturalist like myself, even though she was a real bookworm and not much of an outdoorswoman. So yes, it could be said that I took after her. I guess my interest in nature was just more practical than hers. Even though I may never match her in erudition, I hope that she could still be proud of me.~
@6127 = ~Yes, I learned most of what I know about nature from my mother. Most important of all, she taught me how to listen to it; it's not about how much you know, but how much you can hear nature tell you.~

@6131 = ~Well, in a way it was. She was one of those stuffy wizards locked away in her chamber. It was because of her that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a druid instead.~
@6132 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with her work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a druid instead. So I guess she was an influence.~
@6133 = ~Well, she was a priestess, so yes, it could be said that I took after her. I just hope that she could be proud of what I have accomplished on my travels. ~
@6134 = ~Well, in a way it was. She was one of those stuffy wizards locked away in her chamber. It was because of her that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a cleric instead.~
@6135 = ~Well, she did have an interest in music, even if it was of a rather different type of music. She was a composer at the ducal court, you see. So I guess it could be said that I took after her. I don't know if she would appreciate my music, though. And I know that she definitely wouldn't appreciate the lifestyle. But I still hope that on some level, she could appreciate what I do.~
@6136 = ~Well, considering that she was a member of the theatrical troupe I grew up in, I would have to say that yes, she had an effect. I don't really think I ever considered becoming anything else than a performer. I just hope my mother would understand why I didn't stay with the company. I just felt I needed to find my own way.~
@6137 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with her work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a bard instead. So I guess she was an influence.~
@6138 = ~Yes, I think she was one of the main reasons why I became a paladin. She was one of the few women in the Flaming Fist at Baldur's Gate, and I always wanted to become a fighter like her. I just found the idea of following orders for the rest of my life rather boring.~
@6139 = ~Well, she was a priestess, so yes, it could be said that I took after her. I just hope that she could be proud of what I have accomplished on my travels.~
@6140 = ~Well, in a way it was. She was one of those stuffy wizards locked away in her chamber. It was because of her that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a paladin instead.~
@6141 = ~You said she taught you much - does that mean that it was because of her you became a monk?~
@6142 = ~Well, she was a traveling monk, so yes, it could be said that I took after her. I have to say that I am proud to walk in her footsteps, and I hope I can take her teachings to places she never had the time to reach.~
@6143 = ~Well, in a way it was. She was one of those stuffy wizards locked away in her chamber. It was because of her that I decided to keep away from arcane magic and become a monk instead.~
@6144 = ~Well, it was mainly because I hated everything that had to do with her work in the temple, that I decided to keep away from all of the gods and become a monk instead. So I guess she was an influence.~
@6145 = ~Well, she wouldn't have been much of an artist if she hadn't understood, would she? It doesn't really matter if you view performing as an art or a craft, in either case you will have to find your own way of doing it. Not that I see anything wrong in carrying on the tradition as it has always been, but even then, you'd have to feel that it's what you want to do, wouldn't you?~
@6146 = ~Yes, I think you are right. I believe she did understand.~
@6147 = ~Well, I hope you are right. I would hate for her to think that I didn't value her teachings.~
@6148 = ~It is not hard to see that her teachings have fallen on a fertile ground, so to speak. You should consider yourself blessed for having had the benefit of her love and wisdom.~
@6149 = ~And that's why you set out adventuring the first chance you got, right? Well, seems that you have done all right up to now - having survived this far. And considering who you've been travelling with, that is no mean feat. I am sure that your mother would be proud of you.~
@6150 = ~Why is that? Did she treat you that bad or didn't you just get along with her?~
@6151 = ~Well, having an overzealous Flaming Fist sergeant for a mother is not exactly the recipe for the perfect childhood.~
@6152 = ~I think she was all right when she was sober, although I didn't see her much in that state. Obviously she managed to carry out her job well enough since she managed to keep it. Mostly I saw her only in the evenings when I got her home from the tavern and in the mornings when she was grumpy and hung over.~
@6153 = ~I'd say that my mother would easily qualify as one of those select few. At least she was definitely more eccentric than our neighbours. Any of them.~
@6154 = ~If she truly was that mad, why didn't anyone try to do something to ease her condition?~
@6155 = ~Well, we took her to the village healer who tried, but apparently there was nothing she could do. Couldn't even figure out what was wrong with her.~

@6161 = ~Come on, <PLAYER2>. You must have something to say about them. How do you remember them?~
@6162 = ~Well, my parents were merchants, so I guess you could see some twisted kind of a connection. I guess I just have a slightly different outlook on property rights than they did.

@6200 = ~Why is that? Did they treat you that bad or didn't you just get along with them?~
@6201 = ~Well, having overzealous officers of the Flaming Fist for parents is not exactly the recipe for the perfect childhood.~
@6202 = ~Well, I think 'eccentric' is putting it rather mildly. I would say that their obsession with arcane learning went beyond mere eccentricity. ~
@6203 = ~I'd say that my parents would easily qualify as one of those select few. At least they was definitely more eccentric than our neighbours. Any of them.~

@6211 = ~Sounds familiar. I'm glad that you at least found yourself a place among others. As you can probably well imagine, that was always something of a problem for me. Wasn't always easy being the odd one - children can make the truest of friends, but they can also be exquisitely cruel when they want to.~
@6212 = ~Well, at least after surviving such a childhood more or less unscathed, we can both be pretty sure that we can handle whatever life chooses to hurl at us in the future.~
@6213 = ~Why is that? Is there something about your childhood that you do not wish me to know? Or do you just think that I could not possibly understand, never having even known my own parents?~
@6214 = ~Calm down, Amber. It has nothing to do with you. My father is just something I would rather forget. Couldn't we just leave it at that?~
@6215 = ~Calm down, Amber. It has nothing to do with you. My mother is just something I would rather forget. Couldn't we just leave it at that?~
@6216 = ~Calm down, Amber. It has nothing to do with you. My parents are just something I would rather forget. Couldn't we just leave it at that?~

@6218 = ~There are no skeletons in my closet, if that is what you mean. I just cannot see how my childhood would be of any interest to you.~
@6219 = ~Well, to be quite honest, I don't think you could ever understand. In any case, I do not wish to discuss my family matters with you.~
@6220 = ~As you wish. As much as I would have liked to learn of your past, I will respect your need for privacy.~
@6221 = ~Of course it interests me. Our past has a great deal to do with who we are. And I do want to know to get to know you better, <PLAYER2>.~
@6222 = ~Very well. What was it that you wished to know about my father?~
@6223 = ~Very well. What was it that you wished to know about my mother?~
@6224 = ~Very well. What was it that you wished to know about my parents?~
@6225 = ~Very well. What was it that you wish to know about my childhood?~
@6226 = ~I am here for you to know. You do not need to know my parents to know me.~
@6227 = ~Fine. Keep your secrets, but do not presume to know what I can or cannot understand.~
@6228 = ~Are you sure it wasn't you who had trouble understanding things? I would bet that they were only trying to do what's best for you, but you were probably just too young and inexperienced to see it. And apparently, you have learned little since.~
@6229 = ~I just wanted to know how do you remember him. What is he like in your memories?~
@6230 = ~I just wanted to know how do you remember her. What is she like in your memories?~
@6231 = ~I just wanted to know how do you remember them. What are they like in your memories?~
@6232 = ~I just wanted to know how do you remember your stay among the monks of Candlekeep. What was it like in your memories?~
@6233 = ~Well, I never felt that I belonged there, but I guess it was at least as much my fault as it was theirs.~
@6234 = ~You never mentioned anything about your parents. What were they like?~
@6235 = ~ I was actually much closer with my mother than with my father. He was always a very distant figure in my life.~
@6236 = ~Why is that? Is there something about your childhood that you do not wish me to know? Or do you just think that I could not possibly understand, never having had anywhere to call home?~
@6237 = ~Well, to be quite honest, I don't think you could ever understand. In any case, I do not wish to discuss my childhood with you.~
@6238 = ~Then we have more in common than I had realised. A pity, really. I would not wish a childhood like that to anyone. ~
@6239 = ~How do you feel about <CHARNAME> using <PRO_HISHER> divinely granted powers? Do you think <PRO_HESHE> was meant to use them, or do you think <PRO_HESHE> should just try to ignore them and survive on <PRO_HISHER> mortal abilities alone?~
@6240 = ~I see no harm in <PRO_HIMHER> using whatever powers <PRO_HESHE> has been given. I see them as a gift and refusing to use them would seem ungrateful.~
@6241 = ~I have no objections with <PRO_HIMHER> using <PRO_HISHER> powers, as long as they are used only to good ends. I don't believe that <CHARNAME> is bound to <PRO_HISHER> father's evil. We are all free to choose our own paths in life.~
@6242 = ~I know <PRO_HESHE> tries to fight back, but it is clearly not easy. The urge to wield the powers given to <PRO_HIMHER> is just too strong. I'm afraid it will tear <PRO_HIMHER> apart.~
@6243 = ~You have seen nothing yet, Amber. Bhaal's legacy is <PRO_HISHER> destiny and someday <PRO_HESHE> will rise to wield <PRO_HISHER> power in its full potential. When that happens, I will become <PRO_HISHER> right hand.~
@6244 = ~I see. Well, at least *you* seem to have a clear opinion on what <CHARNAME> should do with <PRO_HISHER> 'gift'.~
@6245 = ~I, on the other hand, feel somewhat ambivalent about the things *I* can do. Granted, my powers have merely a fiendish origin, as opposed to <PRO_HISHER> divine roots, but they are both derived from something utterly evil.~
@6246 = ~Think nothing of it, Amber. It was the least any friend could do. Those slavers make me sick and I would aid anyone captured by them.~
@6247 = ~To tell you the truth, it was a bit tedious - having to come all the way just to save your butt and all for nothing. Friends are useful to have around, but I did it just because <CHARNAME> insisted on it.~
@6248 = ~Do not take it personally Amber. I understand the value of friends in a tight spot, but my loyalties lie with <CHARNAME> and it's just not wise for me to get too attached to anyone. And besides, I did come after you, didn't I?~
@6249 = ~I saved you this time as I consider you a valuable ally, but I do not want you to get any ideas. The only reason you are still with us is because <CHARNAME> knows you can pull your load and because you have abilities that we need. Our relationship is strictly business and that is how it is going to stay.~
@6250 = ~Maybe I should have told <CHARNAME> not to come after you, after all. If all you are going to do is whine and moralise, I don't think <CHARNAME> will tolerate that for long. That is not why <PRO_HESHE> took you with us.~
@6251 = ~ If that is what you want, that is what you are going to get. Just don't expect anyone to show you true commitment in a tight spot unless you are willing to do the same.~ [m#amb108]
@6252 = ~Well, maybe I should not have come back at all, then. Luckily that mistake is an easy one to correct.~
@6253 = ~However, I will not ditch <CHARNAME> just because <PRO_HESHE> has made a poor choice in dragging you along.~
@6254 = ~Oh? It was? Well, I suppose that I overreacted.  Let's go then, as friends.~
@6255 = ~Look at the stars, <CHARNAME>. They are so pale and calm. Sometimes I wonder if they serve any other purpose besides comforting a troubled mind?~ [m#amb116]
@6256 = ~I know it sounds crazy, but I like to think that stars are little suns like ours  - each shining for their own Faerûn.~
@6257 = ~A gypsy storyteller once told me a story where the stars were shining gems on the cloak of the goddess Selune.~
@6258 = ~This really is not the right time to be gawking at stars, Amber.~
@6259 = ~Fine, be boring if you want to.~
@6260 = ~You certainly do have a wild imagination! But in a way that is an amusing thought. Sasha would have laughed at you, though.~
@6261 = ~Sasha?~
@6262 = ~Yeah, well, enough stargazing for tonight - we should move on. The moon is lighting our way now, but it will be gone soon.~
@6263 = ~I have heard the same story! Sasha's mother always told that on dark and clear autumn nights. I used to love it; she was a great storyteller.~
@6264 = ~He was my friend and trapeze partner in the circus I used to travel with. We used to lay on the roof of the wagon we shared and watch stars on clear nights like this.~ [m#amb117]
@6265 = ~It might seem sort of silly, but I gave him a star after I heard he had died. That bright one right there. And I gave Jill one too - you can't see it now - the moon is too close to it. I like to think that they are watching over me from up there.~ [m#amb118]
@6266 = ~But now, we should get going if we plan to get anywhere tonight. I can admire stars some other time.~
@6267 = ~<CHARNAME>, you must be joking! There is no way I will take the lead.~
@6268 = ~But why not?~
@6269 = ~Of course you will. If for no other reason than because *I* say so.~
@6270 = ~Relax, I just wanted to see how eager you'd be to step into my boots. ~
@6271 = ~Do I need a reason for everything? I simply don't care to ponder whether this or that is the right decision or how it will affect those following me. Neither could I stand the constant nagging by those who feel that their opinion is not properly taken into account. I'm much more comfortable having to think only for myself.~
@6272 = ~Besides, if I was the one making the final decisions, how would I ever get to say 'told you so'?~
@6273 = ~Well, you certainly do like to be right, you got that one right.~
@6274 = ~I think you have a point. A good leader needs to keep other member of the group happy and listen to them.~
@6275 = ~Bah, there is no need to pay heed to what your underlings think. A good leader is firm and does what he or she thinks is for the best.~
@6276 = ~And what on earth do you dream of accomplishing by that? I really wouldn't care having anyone else's life on my responsibility.~
@6277 = ~Yeah, you are right. I just wanted to see how eager you'd be to step into my boots.~
@6278 = ~Relax, I just wanted to see how eager you'd be to step into my boots.~
@6279 = ~All right, point taken.~
@6280 = ~Very funny. Besides, your boots smell vile and I wouldn't touch them with a ten-foot pole.~
@6281 = ~Very funny. Besides, you don't even wear boots.~
@6282 = ~Good.~
@6283 = ~Who doesn't? You're no saint in that respect, either, so don't you get all holier than thou on me.~
@6284 = ~I don't think it's that simple. If you always try to make everyone happy, you will end up getting nothing done. Besides, only a few people are willing to trust their lives to the hands of a leader who displays no backbone at all. Achieving that trust is the hardest part of leadership, I think.~
@6285 = ~I don't think it's that simple. If you don't trust your comrades enough to pay attention to what they have to say, how can you trust them in the thick of battle?~
@6286 = ~Enough of this, let's get moving. After you, <CHARNAME>.~
@6287 = ~Anyhow, I believe that I have now made my dislike towards leadership quite clear. After you, <CHARNAME>.~
@6288 = ~Yeah, well, enough stargazing for tonight - we should move on.The moon is lighting our way now, but it will be gone soon.~
@6289 = ~It might seem silly but I gave him a star after I heard he had died. That bright one right there. And I gave Jill one too - you can't see it now - the moon is too close to it. I like to think that they are watching over me from up there.~
@6290 = ~You look worried, <CHARNAME>. Is there something that troubles you?~ [m#amb043]
@6291 = ~I don't know... It's just... What if we're too late? What if we can't save Imoen? What if... he has done something to her? I could never forgive myself.~
@6292 = ~I don't know... It's just... What if we're too late?  What if Irenicus gets away again? That wizard has caused so much trouble already.~
@6293 = ~I was just thinking about the things I'd like to do to that wizard Irenicus. I can't wait to get my hands on him. If he has so much as laid a finger on Imoen, he will come to rue the day he was born.~
@6294 = ~I was just thinking about the things I'd like to do to that wizard Irenicus. He shall bitterly regret what he has done - I will make him pay for humbling me. He will learn never to mess with a Bhaalspawn again.~
@6295 = ~I really don't think that you should be prying into my thoughts like this, Amber. I'm fine, really. Just mind your own business.~
@6296 = ~It would be foolish of me to promise that everything will be all right. We can only hope to make it in time to save your friend. Judging by what I have heard of Imoen, she seems like a strong-willed person. And besides, at least she can be sure that you will do everything in your power to free her. She is very lucky to have someone like you as her friend.~ [m#amb044]
@6297 = ~It would be foolish of me to promise that everything will be all right. I haven't known you for that long yet, but I've got the impression that you're not one to give up easily. We will track him down eventually.~ [m#amb044]
@6298 = ~You have done your best and there's no use agonising over what you could have done differently. It will change nothing.~
@6299 = ~I suppose that you are right, but we have lost so much time already that I am simply getting worried.~
@6300 = ~No, I could always have done better. I should have worked harder, and if we arrive too late, I will have no-one to blame but myself.~
@6301 = ~Well, it's no wonder that we haven't made better progress, seeing that I'm surrounded by people with your level of commitment. If something does go wrong, it's because we didn't try hard enough.~
@6302 = ~It would be a small wonder if you did not worry. But as it stands, we can do naught but press on. Cheer up <CHARNAME>, we'll get to Irenicus soon enough.~
@6303 = ~There is no use in torturing yourself with such accusations. Cheer up <CHARNAME>, we'll get to Irenicus soon enough.~
@6304 = ~I suppose that it's always easier to blame someone else, but it won't do much good for your cause. Cheer up <CHARNAME>, we will get to Spellhold, eventually.~
@6305 = ~You would do wisely to try and calm your anger. Wizards can be tricky to deal with; we should proceed carefully.~
@6306 = ~Who are you to come and judge me? We will make Irenicus suffer and there is no need to sneak around. Enough time has been wasted already.~
@6307 = ~I see your point, Amber, but you should try to place yourself in my position. It is not that easy to hold your temper when pushed into a situation like this.~
@6308 = ~Why am I even discussing this with you? You obviously have no idea of what I am going through here.~
@6309 = ~You are right. Giving in to anger will not do me much good. Thank you for keeping my temper in check, Amber.~
@6310 = ~Fine, don't listen to me. Let's just hope that I don't have to say 'I told you so' later on.~
@6311 = ~I understand. Just promise me that you'll at least try, OK?~
@6312 = ~Anytime, <CHARNAME>.~
@6313 = ~I'm afraid that at this point your business and my business are to a great extent the same thing - at least when it comes to your wellbeing.~ [m#amb045]
@6314 = ~(Amber frowns.) Now that sounded a bit more possessive than I intended... <CHARNAME>, I really care for you, and I really would like to help you any way I can. Would you please share your troubles with me?~ [m#amb046]
@6315 = ~I don't know... It's just... What if we're too late? What if we cannot save Imoen? What if... he has done something to her? I could never forgive myself.~
@6316 = ~I don't know... It's just... What if we're too late?  What if Irenicus gets away again? That wizard has caused so much trouble, already.~
@6317 = ~No, Amber. I understand your concern, but I'm fine. Really, I am.~
@6318 = ~Well, have it your way. But don't think that I cannot see when you are suffering.~
@6319 = ~Very well, I'll leave you to your thoughts. Just try not to lead us astray while you concentrate on looking inside yourself instead of looking ahead.~ [m#amb047]
@6320 = ~This must be one of the worst rat holes I've seen in my life. Nothing but drunken cut-throats and their wenches. We'd better keep our eyes open here, <CHARNAME>, and not just for vampires. In a place like this your life is worth less than the contents of your purse.~
@6321 = ~You're right, we should keep a sharp eye. I've been looking over my shoulder ever since that cursed Havarian betrayed us to those vampires.~
@6322 = ~I'll be careful enough. There is no need for you to remind me of that, Amber.~
@6323 = ~I really don't see how a few drunken sailors could pose us a threat of any kind.~
@6324 = ~I'm glad that you see my point, <CHARNAME>.~
@6325 = ~You can never be too careful, <CHARNAME>.~
@6326 = ~You should not judge things by their appearance, <CHARNAME>. I thought that you would have learned that by now.~
@6327 = ~If I know something about sailors  - or pirates, if you will - it is that they are rarely as drunk as they seem to be. Neither are they as stupid as they look. Just be careful, all right?~
@6328 = ~This must be one of the most bizarre places in the world. I've seen many strange places in my life, but a city populated by shark men is something quite unexpected. It does have a kind of savage beauty to it, though.~ [m#amb049]
@6329 = ~I do not doubt for a moment that you could show me many things. Neither do I doubt that your generous offer has a price I'm not willing to pay - thus I have to decline.~
@6330 = ~<CHARNAME>, have you ever seen anything like this place? ~
@6331 = ~No, I don't believe that I have. It might well be that we are the first land-dwellers to behold these caverns. We should consider ourselves lucky.~
@6332 = ~No, but I don't think this place is that special. It is just one among the many wonders I have seen.~
@6333 = ~No, but I don't think that this is a good time to discuss aesthetics. Our lives are hanging by a thread and we should concentrate on getting away from this place before we get eaten.~
@6334 = ~I agree, but it is only after we have managed to get out of here alive that we can consider ourselves truly blessed.~
@6335 = ~Then you must have seen magnificent things indeed. Not many people could say the same.~
@6336 = ~You're right, <CHARNAME>. The looks that these sahuagin bestow on us are far from kind. *Hungry* would be more like it.~
@6337 = ~Nevertheless, I think this place is breathtaking, and I don't think that I will ever forget it. Whether it will grace my dreams or haunt my nightmares remains to be seen.~
@6338 = ~(You are preparing to rest for the night - or day - you really cannot tell the difference in these endless tunnels. Amber, however, is not unpacking. Instead she is sitting on a large rock, staring into the darkness.)~
@6339 = ~(Leave Amber alone and go to sleep.)~
@6340 = ~What's the matter, Amber? You should rest - we will need all of our strength if we intend to survive here.~
@6341 = ~Does it not bother you? Being here? I... I feel like I'm suffocating, like all this darkness and the weight of the stone above is crushing me.~
@6342 = ~I thought you disliked the brightness of sunlight.~
@6343 = ~Well, you'd better get used to it. Looks like we'll be stuck here for quite a while.~
@6344 = ~Yeah, whatever. I'll just go to sleep now, if you don't mind.~
@6345 = ~ Well, it seems that I dislike total darkness even more. If we ever get out of these accursed tunnels again, I think I will have to revise my opinions on sunlight.~
@6346 = ~Not that long, if I have a say in the matter. I have no idea how we're going to get out of here, but after we do... catching up with Irenicus should feel like a walk in the park.~
@6347 = ~You must be tired already, <CHARNAME>. Don't let me keep you from resting.~
@6348 = ~<CHARNAME>! I can smell fresh air coming from the north! We cannot be far from the surface!~ [m#amb051]
@6349 = ~Yes, I noticed it too. But we are not out yet, and it looks like we're not going to get anywhere without one more fight.~
@6350 = ~You really think so, Amber? That would be welcome news indeed!~
@6351 = ~Amber, there is no time to waste! Stop sniffing the air and run along. There is a battle to be fought!~
@6352 = ~I'm afraid that you're right, but I am anxious to see the sky again.~ [m#amb052]
@6353 = ~Yes, I'm positive of it, but I don't think that getting there will be anywhere near easy.~ [m#amb053]
@6354 = ~Well, excuse me if I'm happy about the thought of seeing the sky again. Don't tell me that you feel so comfortable in these musty caverns that you would not like to breathe the fresh air again.~ [m#amb054]
@6355 = ~We should be careful, though. I'm not at all certain that the elves guarding the temple will not slay us just as they slay the drow. We happened to arrive here at a rather unfortunate hour, right in the middle of a drow assault.~
@6356 = ~Not that the elves would probably give a very warm welcome to anything coming out of the Underdark at any hour.~
@6357 = ~I would never have imagined saying this, but I'm glad to feel the sun on my face. It's good to leave those dank, twisted tunnels of the Underdark behind. I don't think the world is ever going to be quite the same for me, though.~ [m#amb055]
@6358 = ~Yeah, whatever. We really need to get going now, Amber. There is no time for idle chatter.~
@6359 = ~Never going to be the same? What do you mean by that?~
@6360 = ~Yes, witnessing the cruelty of the drow from such a close distance is heart wrenching.~
@6361 = ~Yes, it's good to be outside again. But we should move on, Amber. As much as I would like to chat with you, we simply have no time.~
@6362 = ~Actually I was not referring to the drow, but rather to their pale surface-dwelling cousins.~
@6363 = ~You see, I have always thought of elves as wise and benevolent beings. Perhaps a bit uptight and peculiar in certain ways, but somehow 'good' nevertheless. But the battle we fought at the temple ruins... it really opened my eyes.~ [m#amb056]
@6364 = ~Those elven soldiers seemed to take enormous pleasure in killing the drow. They did not simply kill them quickly and cleanly, but rather prolonged the moment of their death, savouring every moment. Naturally the drow asked for no mercy, but none would have been granted them even if they had.~
@6365 = ~But the drow are evil and ruthless, Amber. You saw that in Ust Natha. And they were the ones who attacked the temple.~
@6366 = ~I'm not sure that I noticed anything like that, but then again, I was busy trying to keep my own head attached to my shoulders.~
@6367 = ~The elves did not blindly murder Viconia, so you really cannot compare them with the drow.~
@6368 = ~I think this conversation is turning rather too philosophical for my tastes. We'd better get going.~
@6369 = ~You certainly had your hands full with those drow, so I guess I can't blame you. But I did notice it and it made me sad in a way. Not that I harbour much love for the drow. Many of them certainly are twisted in their ways...~
@6370 = ~But how can there be any hope for either of them if neither is willing to stop? If for some reason the drow would cease the fighting and stop harassing their surface cousins, would the elves stop as well? Would they not attack a single drow wandering on the surface?~
@6371 = ~Would they not try to destroy the cities of the drow, given half the chance to avenge all the attacks made on their own in times past?~
@6372 = ~Amber, the hatred between the drow and the elves runs all the way to a betrayal and the ensuing hatred among the gods themselves - much deeper than a mere blood feud. It is not simply going to stop one day.~
@6373 = ~The drow are never going stop their attacks, and neither are the surface elves going to let their guard down. That is just the way the world works, Amber.~
@6374 = ~Perhaps you are right - even though there may not be much hope for a peace between the two, we will at least have to believe in the possibility, lest we assume the guilt for having killed whatever semblance of hope there might have been.~
@6375 = ~I just cannot believe that they are all utterly evil just because they are drow. I just cannot. If all of us were fundamentally good or evil on the basis of just some divine scheme, our race or our birthplace, where would that leave me? I simply have no other option but to believe that we are what we make of ourselves.~
@6376 = ~And in order to get a chance of winning, you just have to dare to play the game - no matter what the odds. ~
@6377 = ~In other words you are saying that we cannot afford not to believe. I will have to agree with you in that. What would become of me, were I to lose the hope of overcoming my ancestral heritage? I simply have no other option but to believe that we are able to forge our own destinies.~
@6378 = ~But they would have, had you not been there. Don't you see how powerful you have become? Only a fool would try to stand in your way. It was a good move on her part not to stray far away from your side in the temple. That would probably have meant a bloody end for her.~
@6379 = ~Well, you personally can go to hell for all I care. I would just hate to see them kill you for simply being a drow - instead of killing you for your repulsive and obnoxious personality.~
@6380 = ~I never said I was perfect, but I still would not take pleasure in taking her sorry life, however. She is unpleasant enough alive and I don't see how death would make her any more agreeable.~
@6381 = ~Are you afraid, <CHARNAME>? Of facing Bodhi once more, I mean.~
@6382 = ~What of it, Amber? I don't see anything to worry about.~
@6383 = ~Fear is for children, Amber, and I'm hardly a child any more.~
@6384 = ~I might be a little worried, but don't tell anyone that you noticed.~
@6385 = ~Of course I'm not afraid. You should know better than to even suggest such a thing. Let's move on, there is really no point in this conversation.~
@6386 = ~Are you saying that you are not the slightest bit worried about the vampire matron that you will have to face yet again?~
@6387 = ~That may be true, but foolhardiness is just as childish. Were you truly experienced in life, you would know better than to take such a powerful creature so lightly.~ [m#amb060]
@6388 = ~Duties of the leader, I take it? To show a brave face even when confronted with gravest danger? Don't worry, your secret is safe with me, but do not think that your companions wouldn't understand.~ [m#amb061]
@6389 = ~Bodhi has already slipped from your grasp twice, and I have a feeling that she has yet to show her worst tricks. I have a very bad feeling about this.~
@6390 = ~I have already made her back up twice; what could possibly go wrong now? Apart from the fact that she will not escape so easily this time.~
@6391 = ~I have little choice but to go on. There are too many things at stake here to bail out now. We just have to get rid of Bodhi for good.~
@6392 = ~I think this whole conversation is rather pointless. We should move on.~
@6393 = ~Well, everything, really. You would not be the first to be brought down by careless overconfidence.~
@6394 = ~That is true enough. I am also positive that we will get through this, no matter what the odds.~
@6395 = ~When you first encountered her, she had the benefit of being on her home turf. The second time she had Imoen's soul which undoubtedly enhances her powers. Now she has both of these elements playing to her advantage.~
@6396 = ~Well, I certainly did manage to surprise Bodhi while running her little gauntlet. Have you forgotten?~
@6397 = ~And yet they will do Bodhi little good. Together we will vanquish her and reclaim what she has taken. Or die trying.~
@6398 = ~Bodhi will not withstand the power of my father, Amber.~
@6399 = ~Bodhi certainly has the upper claw again, but we'll just have to take solace in the fact that up to now, we have always managed to beat the odds. Even though I'm not entirely clear about how we actually managed to do that.~
@6400 = ~Thanks for explaining the obvious. Now, if you're done, we should move on.~
@6401 = ~Not of your own volition, might I remind you. I would tend to see the chance of *that* happening again as a benefit for her, not us. Who knows who you will attack if you lose your temper again? As I see it, your companions now have two beasts to worry about - and Bodhi will be the more predictable of them.~
@6402 = ~Hey, don't go signing our death warrants just yet, will you? I said that the odds are not looking that good, but I never mentioned anything about it being impossible. Although recent events have shown that you have a knack for surviving even the impossible, <CHARNAME>.~
@6403 = ~I cannot help feeling cold every time you speak like that.~
@6404 = ~I'm glad to see that you don't feel too depressed.~
@6405 = ~But enough of this, we have tarried long enough already and should move on. Even though I'm not looking forward to this unavoidable meeting with Bodhi, I will nevertheless stand beside you, <CHARNAME>.~
@6406 = ~I am so relieved that we finally got Bodhi off our back. Even though that release is bought with a great pain.~ [m#amb063]
@6407 = ~I wonder what kind of magic makes these trees grow so big. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like it.~ [m#amb064]
@6408 = ~I doubt that there is need for any magic. This is what trees become when left alone for long enough.~
@6409 = ~I would bet the elves who live here somewhere have something to do with it. I am under the impression that they are rather reluctant to let outsiders find their cities.~
@6410 = ~I am not sure, but whatever magic it is, it must be quite powerful indeed.~
@6411 = ~Er... they're just trees. Why are you suddenly so interested in them?~
@6412 = ~We have other, more important things to think about now, Amber. Let's move on.~
@6413 = ~(Amber raises an eyebrow.)  All right... Whatever you say, <CHARNAME>.~
@6414 = ~You must be right about that, <CHARNAME>. But apparently their plan has proven rather too effective, if even they cannot find their own cities without a talisman like Rhynn Lanthorn.~
@6415 = ~I knew you would sense it too. This forest is so very old - it makes you feel rather small and insignificant in comparison.~
@6416 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>, certainly you cannot remain unimpressed by the majesty of this place?~
@6417 = ~What made you think I was talking to you, <CHARNAME>? I was merely thinking aloud.~
@6418 = ~But we should not tarry here. There are sure to be other creatures besides elves living in these woods, and I would imagine that they do not appreciate us trampling around their home. Not to mention that the elves are in dire need of our help in dealing with Irenicus.~
@6419 = ~I-I never thought that something this beautiful could exist. But this city... built to express such grace and harmony - I can hardly believe it's real.~ [m#amb065]
@6420 = ~This is definitely not the right time to stop and admire the architecture. Amber, get a grip on yourself - Suldanessellar is being torn apart by monsters. That problem is not going to solve itself if we just stand here.~
@6421 = ~And that grace is going to be but a memory if we don't do something about all these monsters. Come Amber, now would be the right time for all the heroic deeds you have always wanted to perform.~
@6422 = ~I suppose it is prettier than some of the other cities I have visited, but my main concern is still Irenicus and catching up with him as soon as possible. We should not let the city distract us.~
@6423 = ~Well, lead on then.~
@6424 = ~If this wasn't the most inappropriate place for jokes we have ever been in, I would have to say that it's about time I wound up here - there are a lot of people out there who would be extremely pleased to know that I finally ended up exactly where they wished me.~ [m#amb066]
@6425 = ~Well, this *is* a most inappropriate place for jokes, so why don't you just leave it?~
@6426 = ~Wouldn't you think that *down* here would be more accurate?~
@6427 = ~How could anyone wish for something like that? I would not send even my worst enemy here.~
@6428 = ~Yes, that's probably for the best.~ [m#amb067]
@6429 = ~Yeah, well, down here. I sort of lost my bearings back there. I suppose it's a rather common reaction to getting yanked out of your body.~ [m#amb068]
@6430 = ~Well, it seems that's exactly what happened here. At least *I* would consider that soul-stealing, no-good son-of-an-elf to be a very strong candidate for the title of your worst enemy.~ [m#amb069]
@6431 = ~Do you think we'll ever get out of here?~
@6432 = ~It matters little what I think. I can only hope.~
@6433 = ~It matters little - we will just have to focus on the task at hand and worry about that later.~
@6434 = ~No, I don't really have much faith in us getting out, but I suppose that the only thing we can do is keep going.~
@6435 = ~Hope beyond hope? A familiar concept.~
@6436 = ~My vote would certainly be on doing it sooner rather than later.~
@6437 = ~I have to admit that this counts among the bleaker situations I have found myself in, but I am not quite ready to give up all hope just yet.~
@6438 = ~I don't know... It's just... What if we're too late? What if we can't save Imoen? What if... he has done something to her? I could never forgive myself if we failed to rescue her.~
@6439 = ~I don't know... It's just... What if we're too late?  What if Irenicus gets away again? That wizard has caused so much trouble, already. ~
@6440 = ~I was just thinking about the things I'd like to do to that wizard Irenicus. He shall bitterly regret what he has done - I will make him pay for humbling us. He will learn never to mess with me or <CHARNAME> again.~
@6441 = ~I really don't think you should be prying into my thoughts like this, Amber. I'm fine, really. Just mind your own business.~
@6442 = ~I really don't think you should be prying into  my thoughts like this, Amber. I'm fine, really. Just mind your own business.~
@6443 = ~It would be foolish of me to promise that everything will be all right. We can only hope to make it in time to save Imoen. Judging by what I have heard of her, she seems like a strong-willed person. And besides, at least she can be sure that you and <CHARNAME> will do everything in your power to free her. She is very lucky to have someone like you as her friend.~ [m#amb044]
@6444 = ~It would be foolish of me to promise that everything will be all right. I haven't known you or <CHARNAME> for that long yet, but I've got the impression that you're not the kind of people who give up easily. We will track him down eventually.~ [m#amb044]
@6445 = ~Well, it's no wonder that we have not made better time when <CHARNAME> keeps people with your working morals around. If something goes wrong, it's because we did not try hard enough.~
@6446 = ~There is no use in torturing yourself with such accusations. Cheer up <CHARNAME>, we'll get to Irenicus soon enough. ~
@6447 = ~I suppose that it's always easier to blame someone else, but it won't do much good for our cause. Cheer up <CHARNAME>, we will get to Spellhold, eventually.~
@6448 = ~I see your point, Amber, but you should try to place yourself in my position. It's not that easy to hold your temper when pushed into a situation like this.~
@6449 = ~Why am I even discussing this with you? You obviously have no idea of what I am going through, here.~
@6450 = ~I don't know... It's just... What if we're too late? What if we can't save Imoen? What if... he has done something to her? I could never forgive myself if I failed to rescue her.~
@6451 = ~Very well, I'll leave you to your thoughts. Just try not to stray while you concentrate on looking inside yourself instead of looking ahead.~
@6452 = ~Does it not bother you? Being here? I... I feel like I'm suffocating, like all this darkness and the weight of the stone above is crushing me.~ [m#amb050]
@6453 = ~ Well, you'd better get used to it. Looks like we'll be stuck here for quite a while.~
@6454 = ~Well, it seems that I dislike total darkness even more. If we ever get out of these accursed tunnels again, I think I will have to revise my opinions on sunlight.~
@6455 = ~<CHARNAME> I can smell fresh air coming from the north! We cannot be far from the surface!~ [m#amb051]
@6456 = ~I'm afraid that you're right, but I am anxious to see the sky again.~
@6457 = ~We should be careful, though. I'm not at all certain that the elves guarding the temple will not slay us just as they slay the drow. We happened to arrive here at a rather unfortunate hour, right in the middle of a drow assault. Not that the elves would probably give a very warm welcome to anything coming out of the Underdark at any hour.~
@6458 = ~And in order to get a chance of winning, you just have to dare to play the game - no matter what the odds.~
@6459 = ~I never said I was perfect, but I still would not take pleasure in taking her sorry life. She is unpleasant enough alive and I don't see how death would make her any more agreeable.~
@6460 = ~Are you saying that you are not the slightest bit worried about the vampire matron that you and <CHARNAME> will have to face yet again?~
@6461 = ~That may be true, but foolhardiness is just as childish. Were you truly experienced in life, you would know better than to take such a powerful creature so lightly.~
@6462 = ~A proud one, are we? Compelled to show a brave face even when confronted with gravest danger? Don't worry, your secret is safe with me, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb183]
@6463 = ~We have already made her back up twice; what could possibly go wrong now? Apart from the fact that she will not escape so easily this time.~
@6464 = ~We have little choice but to go on. There are too many things at stake here to bail out now. We just have to get rid of Bodhi for good.~
@6465 = ~Well, we certainly did manage to surprise Bodhi while running her little gauntlet. Have you forgotten?~
@6466 = ~Bodhi will not withstand the power of Bhaal, Amber.~
@6467 = ~Not of your own volition, might I remind you. I would tend to see the chance of *that* happening again as a benefit for her, not us. Who knows who <CHARNAME> will attack if <PRO_HESHE> loses <PRO_HISHER> temper again? As I see it, we now have two beasts to worry about - and Bodhi will be the more predictable of them.~
@6468 = ~<CHARNAME>, look what I found. I thought you might find this interesting, or at least amusing.~ [m#amb152]
@6469 = ~It's a bounty notice with your name on it.~ [m#amb153]
@6470 = ~That's hardly news. There has been a bounty on my head ever since I left Candlekeep.~
@6471 = ~Look, I'm really busy right now. Couldn't that wait until later?~
@6472 = ~All right, I'll show it to you when you have more time.~
@6473 = ~I can believe that, but it looks like whoever drafted this one up didn't get it *quite* right...~
@6474 = ~'Wanted for the murder of Rieltar: <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep.' Then they go on to give details of the time and place of the murder, and then the reward. Wow, not half bad... I think I've seen one of these before, but I didn't really pay much attention to it then. The murderer was really Sarevok, was it not?  There were quite a lot of rumours going on around the Iron Throne.~
@6475 = ~Anyway, but the interesting part comes next: this notice continues with a description of a *woman*.~
@6476 = ~Listen: 'A young woman with shoulder length hair...'~
@6477 = ~I really don't understand what's so interesting about some old bounty notice. We should not be wasting our time like this.~
@6478 = ~I might not be a young woman, but at least they got my hair length right.~
@6479 = ~Well, I'm bald, so...~
@6480 = ~Actually, I have always liked to keep my hair cut just below my ears, so that was indeed a *bit* off.~
@6481 = ~Hah, the last time my hair has been shoulder length was when I was a child; I've kept it longer ever since.~
@6482 = ~That's ridiculous. My hair has always been short and clean-cut.~
@6483 = ~Well, that is something...~
@6484 = ~At least you won't be getting helmet hair.~
@6485 = ~Well, it wasn't *that* far off... You'd only need to go a few months without cutting it and it would be just right. But I guess you never do.~
@6486 = ~And it looks pretty nice too, if you ask me.~
@6487 = ~Well, if nothing else, at least it's low-maintenance.~
@6488 = ~But that's not all they had to say about your hair. It goes on to say: '...of chestnut colour...'~
@6489 = ~My, haven't they been poetic. Why didn't they just settle with 'brown'?~
@6490 = ~I really don't understand what's so interesting about some old bounty notice. We should not be wasting our time for this.~
@6491 = ~Because if they had, it could be confused with sandy brown, like mine really is.~
@6492 = ~Because they got it exactly right: shiny chestnut hair.~
@6493 = ~Hmph... Anyone who really knew what I looked like would say black. *Raven* black, to be more accurate.~
@6494 = ~But I am and have always been a natural blond!~
@6495 = ~Well, they could have said 'auburn' as my hair really is, although I suppose that you could say reddish brown.~
@6496 = ~Well, whoever wrote that thing must have been blind or thinking of someone else. My hair was white already at that time.~
@6497 = ~Chestnut? Wherever did they get that from. Some people might mistakenly call my hair grey, but it should be obvious that it is actually 'silver'.~
@6498 = ~Bah! I would not settle for anything as ordinary as chestnut. It just has to be blue.~
@6499 = ~There are thousands of women with chestnut hair, but only one man with green.~
@6500 = ~I think we can both agree that red is the only option when it comes to hair colour.~
@6501 = ~Well, I don't blame them. I don't believe they could even begin to describe the colour of my hair.~
@6502 = ~Since I am bald, and have been for quite some time, mind you, there is rather little point in trying to describe my hair colour.~
@6503 = ~Fair enough, <CHARNAME>.~
@6504 = ~Or shiny brown, whichever suits you best.~
@6505 = ~Or pitch black? Ink black would not really do since most inks are more of a dark brown, really.~
@6506 = ~Of course you are, <CHARNAME>.~
@6507 = ~True enough, <CHARNAME>.~
@6508 = ~I don't know... Were you to ask someone what colour the clouds are, they would probably say white, but if you really take a good hard look at them, you realise they are actually not white. That's not to say that your hair couldn't be white, though. At least it looks white enough.~
@6509 = ~You are right, I think - it is definitely more silver than grey. Besides, <CHARNAME> Silverhair sounds far more fetching than <CHARNAME> Greymantle.~
@6510 = ~Well, that *is* something you don't see every day.~
@6511 = ~Perhaps... Who knows, maybe we have more in common than just hair colour.~
@6512 = ~Well, I am certainly not going to disagree with you about that.~
@6513 = ~True enough, there would not be much point in that.~
@6514 = ~But if you allow me read on... Where were we? Oh, here we go... 'a young woman with shoulder length hair of chestnut colour, not curled but completely straight.'~
@6515 = ~I wonder why they chose such a peculiar turn of phrase. 'Straight, shoulder length brown hair' would have been clear enough. Sheesh, it is a bounty notice and not a romance novel, after all.~
@6516 = ~Well, they did get that one right, though. Never had a curl in my life. Not even when it rains.~
@6517 = ~Well, they were right in that my hair is not really curly, but I wouldn't call it 'straight' either. I think 'wavy' would be more accurate.~
@6518 = ~That's way out of whack since my hair is curly as a sheep's fleece.~
@6519 = ~Well, they are practically right, since only the tips curve slightly. Otherwise, my hair straight as a nail.~
@6520 = ~I've had these dreadlocks so long I don't even remember whether my hair is curly or straight. Maybe that's what confused them.~
@6521 = ~Hmph, when you're bald, there's not that much to describe, is there? Bloody idiots...~
@6522 = ~Then there are three of us: you, me and this mystery woman who goes by your name in this here bounty notice.~
@6523 = ~Yeah, I guess whoever wrote this doesn't really have an eye for subtle variations.~
@6524 = ~Luckily it is the only thing that's sheepish about you, <CHARNAME>.~
@6525 = ~Yeah. I have noticed that you can practically forecast weather just by looking at your hair: if it curls at the tips, it's bound to be raining soon.~
@6526 = ~By the way, there is a twig stuck in your hair. Here, let's see if I can get it out... All right, now you're all groomed up again.~
@6527 = ~It seems that was all they had to say about her hair. 'She is a human of average height...'~
@6528 = ~Hmph. OK, I am a bit shorter than your average man, but I still cannot understand how they could mistake me for a woman.~
@6529 = ~Well, I am of a rather average height, but I still cannot understand how they could mistake me for a *woman*.~
@6530 = ~Hah, that is ridiculous. I am tall even for a man; how could they ever take me to be a woman of average height?~
@6531 = ~Well, considering that most human females are taller than elven men and I am shorter than most of my kind, I would have to take that characterisation as a compliment.  ~
@6532 = ~Well, I guess I should take that as a testament to my larger-than-life presence, since I would bet that most human women of average height would be taller than an average elven man such as myself.~
@6533 = ~Well, I cannot blame them for mistaking my stature for that of a human woman. Most male elves are shorter than human women, but then again, I am taller than most elven men.~
@6534 = ~Well, although most half-elven men are about the same height as human women, I am afraid that I would fall short of that mark.~
@6535 = ~Well, that would be about right; most half-elven men, including myself, are about the same height as human women.~
@6536 = ~Considering that I am somewhat taller than my average kinsmen, I would like to think of myself as taller than an average human woman.~
@6537 = ~Hah! Someone has truly been blind to confuse a short dwarf male like me with a full-grown human, and a woman, no less. What morons!~
@6538 = ~I've never seen a dwarf the size, much less the shape, of a human woman. They must have been blind to confuse me for one, being that I am no taller than most of my kinsmen.~
@6539 = ~Isn't that hilarious! I may be tall for my kind, but I have never met a human woman the size of myself.~
@6540 = ~Well, well! Someone should indeed have his eyes examined. Confusing a diminutive gnome like myself with a full-grown human woman. Preposterous!~
@6541 = ~I've never seen a gnome the size, much less the shape, of a human woman. They must have been blind to confuse me for one, being that I am no taller than most of my kinsmen.~
@6542 = ~Isn't that something! I may be tall for my kind, but I have never met a human woman the size of myself.~
@6543 = ~I don't know who is it that they have seen, but it definitely is not me. Look at me; I am short even by the standards of my own people, but to confuse me for a full-grown human? That is just plain silly.~
@6544 = ~I don't know who is it that they have seen, but it definitely is not me. I am of only average height among my people, and I doubt that I could find a human woman of my own height.~
@6545 = ~I don't know who is it that they have seen, but it definitely is not me. Although I am rather tall by the standards of my own people, I doubt that there are many human women of my height, and they would certainly be far from the average.~
@6546 = ~Hrmh. A human woman? I may be small in size for my kind, but I am yet to meet a human woman who would match my build. There may well be many of similar height, but one would have to be blind to confuse me with some female.~
@6547 = ~Hrmh. A human woman? I may be of only average height among my kind, but I am yet to meet a human woman as tall, let alone as robust as myself. Only a blind fool could confuse me with some female.~
@6548 = ~Hah! A human woman? I am taller than most males, orc or human, and I'm pretty darned sure that there is not a human woman in this world who would equal my height. Blind fools.~
@6549 = ~Well, I am not exactly tall either, but I have gotten along just fine so far. I guess that makes two of us.~
@6550 = ~For my part, I often wish that there was more of the average in me.~
@6551 = ~I have heard that tall people are generally more respected than those of lesser stature. Personally I would think it dangerous to the point of foolishness to judge a person by his or her stature, but then again, I may be slightly biased on this question.~
@6552 = ~Hmm. It seems that what space they wasted in describing your hair, they are taking back in describing your eyes, since it only says '...with blue eyes'.~
@6553 = ~Funny that they should get that one wrong. They must have not seen me very closely since my eyes are most definitely brown.~
@6554 = ~Blue? I bet the person who wrote that never even saw me, or he would surely have noticed my yellow eyes. I like to think of them as rather striking.~
@6555 = ~Well, I guess you could make that mistake, although in proper lighting, my eyes are quite clearly emerald green.~
@6556 = ~Well, they could have gotten that right just by guessing; half the people in the Sword Coast probably have blue eyes like mine. Based on that description they could have caught almost anyone.~
@6557 = ~My eyes are actually grey, although in a suitable light, you could surely mistake them for blue.~
@6558 = ~If they had been paying any attention, they would surely have noticed that my eyes were actually violet. Or perhaps lavender in bright daylight.~
@6559 = ~Well, that was pretty far off, considering that my eyes are actually pitch black.~
@6560 = ~Well, I don't blame them for getting confused, since I don't really think there is a way to describe the colour of my eyes. Blue was as good a guess as anything.~
@6561 = ~Yeah. They *must* have been thinking about someone else.~
@6562 = ~Well, I don't think anyone who ever saw them properly would disagree with you on that.~
@6563 = ~Quite clearly. They are actually one of the first things I remember noticing about you, <CHARNAME>. They were quite striking even in the dark jail.~
@6564 = ~Well, almost anyone except you, considering that you are most definitely not a woman.~
@6565 = ~There is often a sad aspect to grey eyes, but I don't think that's the case with you.~
@6566 = ~Well, when I first saw you, *I* thought your eyes were blue. But you are right, violet is much closer to truth.~
@6567 = ~Indeed they are.~
@6568 = ~Yes, that's probably the case.~
@6569 = ~They also state that she has no special characteristics apart from... hmmm, that part seems to have been smudged - I can't really make out what it says here.~
@6570 = ~That's it! This has gone long enough! Put away that bounty notice and let's get going.~
@6571 = ~Well, I've got this big scar that that would serve as a good identifier. Could it be that?~
@6572 = ~Well, I do have a broken nose. Hazards of the trade, I suppose. Could it be that?~
@6573 = ~I've got earrings, but that's hardly a special characteristic.~
@6574 = ~I've got this tattoo that that would serve as a really good identifier.~
@6575 = ~Well, not many men have a beard this fine.~
@6576 = ~I'm actually rather proud of my moustache. I have never seen anyone with one quite like mine.~
@6577 = ~I've got this birthmark that would serve as a good identifier.~
@6578 = ~I don't think I have any special characteristics, which is of course good when you want to stay anonymous.~
@6579 = ~Let's see... Where do you have the scar?~
@6580 = ~Erm... Right here on my face.~
@6581 = ~On my arm, I can show you if you want.~
@6582 = ~It's on my leg. Want to see it?~
@6583 = ~Right here on my chest.~
@6584 = ~On my back. I really cannot see it without a mirror.~
@6585 = ~Well... don't laugh, but it's actually on my butt.~
@6586 = ~I would rather not tell you.~
@6587 = ~Let's see... Where do you have the tattoo?~
@6588 = ~Let's see... Where do you have the bithmark?~
@6589 = ~Oh, that one. I thought you had another one somewhere else.~
@6590 = ~It's all right, <CHARNAME>. Maybe later.~
@6591 = ~Ouch, that must have hurt.~
@6592 = ~Well, at least it doesn't remind you of itself all the time. ~
@6593 = ~Well, I'm not going to ask how and when you got it, all right? I don't really want to know.~
@6594 = ~Well, if you feel that shy about it, you can keep your secret. At least for now.~
@6595 = ~Ouch, that must have taken a long time to get done.~
@6596 = ~Well, at least you won't get bored with it.~
@6597 = ~Oh, it certainly is rather unique.~
@6598 = ~Well, it's not as if you could choose where to have it.~
@6599 = ~You have? I haven't even noticed, but now that you mention it, yeah, I guess you can tell. It could be that... or then again, it could be anything. It's just too smudged to tell. ~
@6600 = ~Yeah, I don't know if someone looking for you would consider it special. I have a few, too: two on the left and three on the right ear. It could be that... or then again, it could be anything. It's just too smudged to tell.~
@6601 = ~Well, that certainly is true.~
@6602 = ~Well, neither have I, truth be told. It is quite impressive.~
@6603 = ~Well, you can say that again. There have been times when I had wished I wouldn't have so many unique characteristics. It would have been interesting to see what they had put down as special about you, though. I guess that we'll just never get to know.~
@6604 = ~Well, I think that was it with the bounty notice. No, wait, there is still more!~ [m#amb154]
@6605 = ~'Be warned: she is armed and dangerous.'~ [m#amb155]
@6606 = ~I wonder who is it that they are describing, since you're certainly not a woman, and besides, <CHARNAME> is not exactly a woman's name. Or is there something about you I should know?~ [m#amb156]
@6607 = ~I think they have confused me with Imoen, actually. When you think of it, the description exactly matches her when she hadn't yet changed her hair and got that scar over her eye.~
@6608 = ~I am pretty sure that they have confused me with someone else. There is no other way the description could be so far off.~
@6609 = ~I really don't know. Or care. We have wasted enough time with that stupid bounty notice. Let's go.~
@6610 = ~I have no idea. I can't think of anyone who would fit that description.~
@6611 = ~Now that I think of it, yeah, that sounds quite plausible. Another mystery solved.~
@6612 = ~Yeah, that sounds quite plausible.~
@6613 = ~Really? A pity it is, but I guess it will have to remain a mystery.~
@6614 = ~You are such a bore sometimes, <CHARNAME>. Try to lighten up a bit, will you.~
@6615 = ~I can take the first watch, <CHARNAME>,  but would you care to sit with me for a while?~ [m#amb157]
@6616 = ~I am really tired, Amber. Maybe some other time?~
@6617 = ~Yes, of course Amber. It would be a pleasure to keep you company.~
@6618 = ~If I have to stay up and stand guard, I'd rather not do it with you. Guard duty is unpleasant enough as it is.~
@6619 = ~Normally I would not ask you to waste what little time you have for rest, but I thought that you might be interested in what I have to show you. (She smiles at you coyly.)~ [m#amb158]
@6620 = ~You got me interested now, Amber. What is it?~
@6621 = ~How stubborn can you be? Or are you just stupid? I said I was tired!~
@6622 = ~Just come here and sit down with me...~ [m#amb159]
@6623 = ~(You sit down on a large rock where you could easily see and hear anyone or anything trying to sneak up to your camp.)~
@6624 = ~I have always loved the night and the stars - whenever I was sad or frightened as a kid, I looked up to the heavens for comfort. Stars are so beautiful and tranquil...~ [m#amb160]
@6625 = ~Excuse me for rambling - what I was getting at was that I have always tried to keep track of special events occurring in the heavens. You know, eclipses and such. I am no astronomer, but by listening to the right people - even if they don't always know you are listening - one can learn a great deal.~
@6626 = ~(Put your arm around her waist as she talks.)~
@6627 = ~Is this going somewhere? I thought you said this would be interesting.~
@6628 = ~(Just listen to her talk.)~
@6629 = ~Fine. Your loss, then.~
@6630 = ~I am sorry Amber, I did not mean to be rude. I am just so exhausted I am going out of my mind.~
@6631 = ~(Walk away and go to sleep.)~
@6632 = ~(Amber tenses a little, but does not pull away.)~
@6633 = ~(Amber looks at you as if to find out if you have already dozed off. Her eyes meet yours and for a moment she says nothing.)~
@6634 = ~...anyway, while I was staying in Athkatla, I learned that during <MONTHNAME> there is a good chance of seeing whole hordes of falling stars on clear nights. The astrologer I was listening to also said that events like this are important omens - either good or ill. I do not know how much truth there is to it, but I saw them last night and it was beautiful.~
@6635 = ~I was hoping that you would share the sight with me tonight, <CHARNAME>. (Amber takes your hand, her long fingers entwining with yours.)~ [m#amb163]
@6636 = ~I would like that very much, Amber.~
@6637 = ~That sounds nice, but I think I will have to decline. I can hardly keep my eyes open. See you in the morning.~
@6638 = ~And this is why I wasted my time? To look at stars? You must be out of your mind. I'm going to sleep.~
@6639 = ~(For a moment neither of you says anything. You watch the night sky and the millions and millions of stars shining like little diamonds in its velvety blackness. While you wait, the moon rises, slowly lighting the landscape with its pale shine.)~
@6640 = ~(The night is cool and Amber shivers a little even though you can feel that her hand is much warmer than yours. You turn to look at Amber and shiver in your turn when you notice how the moonlight gives her features an otherworldly shimmer. She glances at you briefly before turning her eyes back to the heavens.)~
@6641 = ~(Try to catch Amber's eyes again.)~
@6642 = ~(Do nothing and idly watch Amber looking at the sky.)~
@6643 = ~(Turn your eyes away from Amber to look at the sky.)~
@6644 = ~Look! There's one! Can you see it, <CHARNAME>? And there's three more!~
@6645 = ~Look! There is one! Hey, you are going to miss them if you keep looking at my face! There's three more!~
@6646 = ~(The excited smile on Amber's face lights up her exotic features. Your eyes follow her lips as she speaks but somehow your mind cannot quite follow her speech.)~
@6647 = ~(Kiss her.)~
@6648 = ~Amber? Would... would you mind if I kissed you?~
@6649 = ~(Say nothing and turn your eyes to the celestial fireworks lighting up the night sky.)~
@6650 = ~(As you sit mesmerised by the shower of shooting stars, you feel Amber's warm body press against your side as she leans towards you, tucking herself under your arm.)~
@6651 = ~(Sit still and wait.)~
@6652 = ~(Lean away from her.)~
@6653 = ~(Amber looks at you surprised, speechless, her eyes mirroring yours. Even in the dim moonlight you can see her blush a little.)~
@6654 = ~(You press your lips gently on Amber's.  Her lips are just as soft and enticing as in your dreams, and you send a quick, silent prayer to the gods, begging for her not to push you away. It seems that the gods look kindly upon you tonight, as she tilts her head back and returns your kiss - gingerly at first, as if uncertain of how to react, but then with a mounting passion.)~
@6655 = ~(You wrap your free hand around her slender shoulders and pull her closer to yourself. In response Amber tightens her grip on your hand until you can feel her nails burrowing into your palm. You hardly even notice the pain as her other hand slowly climbs up your chest.)~
@6656 = ~ (Suddenly you feel Amber freeze in your arms and abruptly break away from you, reaching for her weapon. At the same time, your senses are alerted by the sound of somebody approaching.)~
@6657 = ~I - I think that it is best for me to go to sleep. My watch is over anyway, it seems. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@6658 = ~Hmph. Simply saying no would have taken less effort. If this is how you are when tired, maybe you should indeed go to sleep.~
@6659 = ~(Sensing your apprehension, Amber shifts her balance and pulls away from you. Before you realise what has happened, she is on her feet and climbing down the rock.) I think it would be best if you went to sleep already. I have taken enough time from your rest as it is. I will go and make a few rounds about the camp to see that there are no animals that could steal our food. Good night.~
@6660 = ~(An old, greyed badger stumbles out of the nearby bushes. Startled by your campfire, the creature bolts across the camp, knocking over several items of equipment.)~
@6661 = ~I - I think that it is best for me to go to sleep. My watch is over anyway. You should do the same - it seems that there is no-one about except for harmless woodland creatures. I have heard that badgers are very wary creatures and would not come out of their holes if there were orcs or such anywhere nearby. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@6662 = ~(Amber approaches you with an enigmatic smile playing on her lips. She pulls a pale yellow wild rose from her hair and offers it to you.) Isn't it beautiful? I would like you to have it, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb165]
@6663 = ~(Take it.)~
@6664 = ~(Do not take the flower, just look at it.)~
@6665 = ~(As you take the rose from Amber's hand, your hand briefly touches hers. You could swear that you see a slight blush rise to her cheeks.)~
@6666 = ~(This particular rose might not be the most magnificent flower you have ever laid your eyes on, but upon closer examination you notice that it is nevertheless rather pretty in its simplicity. Unlike most wild roses, this one has double layer of petals surrounding the slightly darker yellow centre. Tiny dewdrops glisten on the petals, perfecting the image.)~
@6667 = ~Well, do you like it? I admit that it is not much, but I hope it makes the point.~ [m#amb166]
@6668 = ~It is almost as beautiful as its giver, but I was wondering whether its petals are as soft as your lips?~
@6669 = ~But why a yellow rose? Am I to understand that your feelings for me do not warrant a scarlet one?~
@6670 = ~It is pretty and I do understand your intention, but was it necessary to tear it off the bush?~
@6671 = ~Shouldn't it be me giving you flowers, and not the other way around?~
@6672 = ~And the point is?~
@6673 = ~Well, that would be something you will have to investigate in the near future, don't you think?~
@6674 = ~Assuming that you are brave enough, of course. (Amber flashes you a wry smile.)~
@6675 = ~Sometimes a rose is just a rose, <CHARNAME>, regardless of its colour. There simply were no red roses around, and in any case, I wanted to give you something more special than that.~
@6676 = ~Don't try to tell me that I am somehow threatening your male ego, now.~
@6677 = ~Don't worry, <CHARNAME>, you will get plenty of chances to act all sweet and romantic towards me, if that is what you wish.~
@6678 = ~Just that there are beautiful and rare things in this world that I would wish to share with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@6679 = ~What do you mean? The rose bush had many flowers - it is hardly the poorer without this one.~
@6680 = ~But now this rose will just wither away and its beauty will soon be forever gone. It would have been just as lovely a gift had you let it bloom where it was and just pointed it out to me.~
@6681 = ~You could have been scratched by a thorn from the bush. Such scratches can seem insignificant, but they can easily get badly infected.~
@6682 = ~Perhaps you are right.  Thank you for the rose - it is very beautiful, although by no means the most beautiful thing around.~
@6683 = ~All right, you do have a point, <CHARNAME>. From now on I shall do as you suggest.~
@6684 = ~Your concern is touching <CHARNAME>, but I am fine, really. Although it *would* be an embarrassing end - to be mortally wounded by a rose bush.~
@6685 = ~You certainly have a way with words, <CHARNAME>.~
@6686 = ~(Amber reaches to brush your cheek with her fingers.) I wonder if...~ [m#amb167]
@6687 = ~(Do nothing and listen what she is about to say.)~
@6688 = ~(Put your hand on hers.)~
@6689 = ~(Move away from her.)~
@6690 = ~Oh... (Amber pulls her hand away.) I- I don't know what I was thinking. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb168]
@6691 = ~<CHARNAME>, I am sorry about... what happened. You know, last time? I guess I got a little carried away.~ [m#amb169]
@6692 = ~Amber it is-~
@6693 = ~But don't you-~
@6694 = ~I do not-~
@6695 = ~No, please, let me finish. I am just worried about what is happening here, with us growing closer and all that. We could be placing ourselves and possibly even others in grave danger, because of what we are. I can see nothing but misery and despair coming out of this. Perhaps it would be wise to call it a day before it is too late - for both of us.~ [m#amb170]
@6696 = ~Perhaps you are right. We are very different, after all.~
@6697 = ~Amber, from what I have learned about you, I would have expected you to show a little more courage. Let us just take our chances with this, shall we?~
@6698 = ~Amber, this is not the first time you are running away from a similar situation, is it?~
@6699 = ~Amber, this is not the first time you are running away from a similar situation, is it? ~
@6700 = ~Amber, do you not remember what you said to me earlier about having the courage to let others close to you? Now it is your turn to show the courage I know you to possess.~
@6701 = ~I am glad you understand. You are a very sweet man, <CHARNAME>, and you will surely make someone very happy some day, but unfortunately that someone will not be me.~
@6702 = ~Actually, I am not that sure that we should give up on this, Amber. You could well be that someone - I can see no reason why you couldn't. ~
@6703 = ~Yeah, maybe I will. But now we must get moving, friend.~
@6704 = ~<CHARNAME>, please trust me on this one. There is nothing that I can give to you. Our future together could never hold anything but disaster for the both of us.~
@6705 = ~All right, have it your way, then. Let us continue our travels as friends, if that is what you wish.~
@6706 = ~(Amber looks down and hesitates for a moment.) I am so confused, <CHARNAME>... I just don't know what to do.~ [m#amb199]
@6707 = ~(Take Amber's hand and look deep into her eyes.) I think you do, Amber.~
@6708 = ~Amber, please, if you will not give us a chance, you will never know what could have come out of it. Are you not the least bit curious?~
@6709 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I am sorry. I just cannot fool myself into doing this. I have a bad feeling about it and you will just have to accept my decision. I am sorry if I have led you to believe something else - it was not my intention to do so. Sometimes I just hope that life would have something to offer besides loneliness, and get carried away by the slightest prospect. But I realise now that it was only a foolish dream and I should have known better.~ [m#amb171]
@6710 = ~ I will not discuss this any further. We should move on, as friends.~
@6711 = ~How can you presume to know something about that? (Amber's voice is neutral, but you can see a flash of pain in her eyes.)~ [m#amb173]
@6712 = ~(Amber takes a deep breath.) You are right <CHARNAME>, as always. I would gain very little by not taking my chances with you. As unwise as it might seem, I am willing to try and see if there is some small hope for us after all.~ [m#amb175]
@6713 = ~(As you are about to leave the common room to go to bed, Amber, who has been sitting on the other side of the room, gets up and approaches you.) <CHARNAME>, wait. I-I was wondering if you would mind... if I could... come up to your room for a while. We could talk and maybe...~ [m#amb176]
@6714 = ~Of course, Amber, I would be delighted. I am not that tired yet and we could pour ourselves a glass of wine or something. After all, this common room is a bit too noisy to properly relax in.~
@6715 = ~I do not think that would wise right now, Amber. To be honest, I am happy that we have grown this close lately and I would not want to ruin it by placing you, or me for that matter, into a situation we are not ready for. I hope you understand me.~
@6716 = ~As good as that sounds, I am afraid I will simply have to get some sleep now - I am just dead tired. I will see you in the morning, Amber. Pleasant dreams.~
@6717 = ~Why would I want you in my room? If you were thinking of getting to sleep with me, you can forget it. You would be the last person I would let in my bed.~
@6718 = ~(She looks at you with her eyes shining.) Now that should prove interesting. Shall we go then, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb177]
@6719 = ~Yes, this way. (Escort Amber to your room.)~
@6720 = ~Um, on a second thought, I am not sure this is such a good idea after all. I am happy that we have grown more close lately, but I would not want to ruin it by getting into a situation I am not ready for. I hope you understand me, Amber.~
@6721 = ~I understand you, and although that was not the answer I was hoping for, I will respect your decision. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@6722 = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>. Have a good night.~
@6723 = ~(Amber stares at you in amazement for a split second then lifts her chin defiantly with her eyes blazing.) I cannot believe what you are saying! You must be crazy! I could never make myself sleep with you - what in the Nine Hells gave you the idea I would ever want to?~ [m#amb178]
@6724 = ~(Amber turns on her heels with a contemptuous snort and walks angrily to her room.)~
@6725 = ~(When you reach your room, Amber walks past you and stops in the middle of the room, standing beside the bed with her back towards you. She is not wearing her armour, only a light brown sleeveless leather top and a pair of buckskin trousers.)~
@6726 = ~You did not really ask me here for a glass of wine, did you?~
@6727 = ~Well... I take it that you are not really interested in talking either, are you? (You walk up to her and hug her from behind, pressing your body against hers while kissing the nape of her neck and her bare shoulders.)~
@6728 = ~Uh... What do you mean? Of course I invited you here for a glass of wine. Or was there something else you had in mind?~
@6729 = ~Err... What? If you were thinking of getting to sleep with me, you can forget it. You would be the last person I would let in my bed.~
@6730 = ~(Amber presses her back against you, one hand fondling your thigh and the other reaching back to pet the back of your neck, as if to encourage you to continue kissing her.) No, I am not, am I... (She turns around in your embrace and looks deep into your eyes with her lips slightly parted, moist and inviting.) I am not afraid of you, <CHARNAME>. (She reaches forward to kiss your lips.)~
@6731 = ~(Lean in to respond to her kiss.)~
@6732 = ~(Gently push her back.) Afraid? What do you mean by that? Maybe we should not-~
@6733 = ~Hush, my love... (She presses one of her long fingers on your lips to quiet you.) Forget that I said anything at all.~
@6734 = ~(Step closer and embrace her.)~
@6735 = ~(Do not resist.)~
@6736 = ~(Push Amber gently, but firmly away.) Amber, look, I am not sure this is such a good idea after all. I am happy that we have grown more close lately, but I would not want to ruin it by getting into a situation we are not ready for. I hope you understand me, Amber.~
@6737 = ~(Amber draws closer, takes hold of your hands and places them on her body. You can feel every curve of her toned figure and the heat that emanates from within her. You cannot help but marvel at the way her body feels -  so fragile and yet so strong...)~
@6738 = ~(Your thoughts are interrupted by her lips pressing hungrily against yours and her tongue looking to enter your mouth. You slide your hand lovingly down her spine to her slim waist and pull her tighter against yourself. Every notion of time and place are lost to you when she gently pushes you onto the bed.)~
@6739 = ~Perhaps... (Amber turns around and walks to you. Slowly she wraps her arm around your waist and looks deep into your eyes with her lips slightly parted, moist and inviting.) I am not afraid of you, <CHARNAME>. (She reaches forward to kiss your lips.)~
@6740 = ~(Bolt away from her.) Whoa! I definitely did not see that coming! Erm... I honestly thought that you came here just for the wine. Perhaps... Perhaps you should go now - I really don't think that I am ready for this just yet.~
@6741 = ~Well, it seems we had something of a misunderstanding, then. Although this was not the outcome I was hoping for, I will respect your decision. Good night, <CHARNAME>.~
@6742 = ~(As you wrap your arms around her, she presses her lean body against you, enabling you to feel every detail of her delicate figure and the tantalising heat that emanates from within her. You cannot help but marvel at the way her body feels -  so fragile and yet so strong...)~
@6743 = ~(Your thoughts are interrupted by her lips pressing hungrily against yours and  her tongue looking to enter your mouth. You slide your hand lovingly down her spine down to her slim waist and pull her tighter against yourself. Every notion of time and place are lost to you when she gently pushes you onto the bed.)~
@6744 = ~(When you first wake up, you feel slightly disoriented for a second. Then you remember, and a warm sensation washes over you as you turn to look at the woman still fast asleep beside you.)~
@6745 = ~(Amber's long red hair is scattered across the bedding, the pale moonlight playing on her hair and turning it into a magnificent net of gold, red and silver.)~
@6746 = ~(Kiss her eyelids.)~
@6747 = ~(Stroke her gently.) Amber? Hey sleeping beauty, time to get up.~
@6748 = ~(Get up, dress and leave as quickly and quietly as possible.)~
@6749 = ~(Amber's long red hair is scattered over the bedding, a magnificent net of red, gold and copper, glimmering in the dancing rays of the sun.)~
@6750 = ~Mmph... Oh, morning lovely. (She reaches up to kiss you, but there is a distant feeling about her that you are sure was not there last night.)~ [m#amb186]
@6751 = ~Amber, what is it? You are not regretful of last night, are you? I mean how was it for you?~
@6752 = ~Um... I really don’t think that we have time for that. We should be going, already.~
@6753 = ~(Kiss her like you mean it.)~
@6754 = ~No, I had made up my mind, so there are no regrets... (She blushes slightly.) But to tell you the truth it felt...~ [m#amb187]
@6755 = ~...a bit awkward and... well, weird.~ [m#amb188]
@6756 = ~Awkward and weird? But I-~
@6757 = ~How can you say that? I thought-~
@6758 = ~Well, since we are being truthful here, I have to say that there-~
@6759 = ~No, no you are getting it all wrong, <CHARNAME>! Now, listen to me... (She grabs your jaw gently but firmly and turns your head, forcing you to look straight into her eyes, piercing right through your heart.)~ [m#amb189]
@6760 = ~I have no illusions about still having a lot to learn about love. How could it be otherwise? During my long life I have never been with another person like this. How could it be anything but awkward and weird to me? Actually you should think of it as a compliment. It could very well have been both frightening and awful, you know, had it not been with you.~ [m#amb190]
@6761 = ~Sure, I did ask Imoen for a few pointers, but there is a world of difference between talking about something and actually doing it. Not everything can be expressed in words.~
@6762 = ~And you, <CHARNAME>... You were wonderful, loving and gentle. What more could a girl ask?~ [m#amb191]
@6763 = ~Someone more thoughtful and well... *better*, if you catch my drift.~
@6764 = ~Well, I don't know, but I think we should get up now.~
@6765 = ~Beats me... (Get up, dress and slip away as quickly as possible.)~
@6766 = ~Hush now, <CHARNAME>. What is done is done, and I would not have it any other way. (She bends down to kiss your navel.) Why don't I find out what you really like? (She slides her hands affectionately down your sides as she delivers another wet kiss, this time well below your navel.) Hmm... Later we can maybe talk a little more about what you can do for me?~ [m#amb192]
@6767 = ~Whatever you say, <CHARNAME>, but I just wanted to let you know that I would not trade what happened for anything. It really was special.~ [m#amb194]
@6768 = ~<CHARNAME>, what do you look for in a woman?~ [m#amb203]
@6769 = ~Now, that's a loaded question. Why do you ask?~
@6770 = ~Heh, for some reason I smell a trap here. Am I just being paranoid or is this one of those questions to which there are no right answers?~
@6771 = ~Now that is an interesting question, but I don't think that this is the best moment for asking it. Maybe we can get into that some other time.~
@6772 = ~ Well, one thing I am definitely *not* looking for in a woman is these endless questions. Would a moment of peace once in a while be too much to ask?~
@6773 = ~Perhaps we can...~
@6774 = ~Now don't you try avoiding my question with another one. I do not mean to trap you or anything, I just want an honest answer, not something you think might please me.~ [m#amb204]
@6775 = ~Aww, come on - I bet that you like flattery as much as anyone else.~
@6776 = ~I have no need to look for anything anymore - I already found you.~
@6777 = ~Well, I *have* always fancied redheads.~
@6778 = ~One thing that I would definitely appreciate would be a woman who would not ask so many questions. Is a moment of peace too much to ask?~
@6779 = ~Ah, you do see right through me. Yes, honest flattery would probably satisfy my curiosity.~
@6780 = ~And honest flattery is what you will get tonight - among other things. If you wish, that is...~
@6781 = ~Well, don't you think that is a bit vain of you, Amber? I certainly have more important things to do than boosting your self-confidence.~
@6782 = ~Hmmm... Let's see... thinking of a perfect woman, what comes to mind is, well... *you*.~
@6783 = ~I don't need to look for anything - I already found you.~
@6784 = ~<CHARNAME>, the best diplomat in the world. Just could not break me the news that a tiefling girl might not have been something you were expecting to make an entrée into your life?~
@6785 = ~Amber, I don't care *what* you are, it is *who* you are that's important. And right now, the only thing that matters is that you are with me.~
@6786 = ~Look, Amber, is this going somewhere or are you just wasting my time with your silly babbling?~
@6787 = ~Well, that might be true, but there have been a whole bunch of things in my life that I never saw coming. In any case I am happy that we met.~
@6788 = ~A bit grumpy today, are we? If peace and quiet is what you are looking for, you have picked the wrong girl for yourself.~
@6789 = ~Just can't take a hint, can you, Amber? Leave me alone, will you?~
@6790 = ~I am sorry, Amber. It is just that I am a bit tired for playing games right now.~
@6791 = ~All right, I wont bother you - for now. A nice, relaxing massage tonight should loosen some of that tension; don't you think.~
@6792 = ~Whatever, <CHARNAME>. Go ahead and be a spoilsport if you wish.~
@6793 = ~Awww... Aren't you just the sweetest, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb205]
@6794 = ~Can I ask you something personal, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb206]
@6795 = ~But certainly, Amber. What is on your mind?~
@6796 = ~Not right now. Can you not see I am busy?~
@6797 = ~<CHARNAME>, do you ever think about powers greater than us? Do you ever cry to the gods for help or advice?~ [m#amb208]
@6798 = ~Yes in fact I do. Praying to my deity gives me a great comfort.~
@6799 = ~The only thing about the gods that I am interested in is to reclaim the place my father has left me among them.~
@6800 = ~No, I don't think that the gods would offer much comfort to a Bhaalspawn.~
@6801 = ~I am not sure if I wish to discuss matters of faith with you, Amber.~
@6802 = ~You have dedicated your life to serve your deity, or a major part of your life at least. May I ask why? What's in it for you, besides the obvious divine powers that are granted to you?~ [m#amb207]
@6803 = ~Power is not everything. Praying to my deity gives me great comfort and peace of mind.~
@6804 = ~My deity serves as an example that I will try to remember well - when I come to my inheritance.~
@6805 = ~Yes, the Stormlord grants me my prayers, but it is also a great honour to serve one so mighty in power.~
@6806 = ~Yes, the Stormlord grants me my prayers, and one day I will be herding a group of followers of my own - when I come to my inheritance.~
@6807 = ~Helm sees everything - knowing that he watches over me as well gives me great comfort.~
@6808 = ~Helm serves as an example that I will try to remember well, - when I come to my inheritance.~
@6809 = ~Power is not everything. Praying to the Morninglord gives me great comfort and peace of mind.~
@6810 = ~Lathander serves as an example that I will try to remember well, - when I come to my inheritance.~
@6811 = ~I see. It is good for you that you have something like that to hold on. I have not been so lucky. Few decent deities would accept a tiefling follower - actually I doubt that any of them would.~
@6812 = ~But certainly it cannot be true that no god would accept you. Your heart is good - would not a goddess like Sune accept you gladly? She prefers beautiful red-haired people.~
@6813 = ~Well, if I ever come to inherit my father's legacy, you could become my follower, Amber.~
@6814 = ~How about Selune? I know you love the stars and she accepts even those that are infected with lycanthropy, if their heart is true.~
@6815 = ~I can promise you that Helm would be more than willing to accept your devotion.~
@6816 = ~I can promise you that Talos would be more than willing to accept your devotion.~
@6817 = ~I guess you are right, but that does not make you any less of a person.~
@6818 = ~I see. It is all power and godhood for you. That path is not going to be easy one to follow, <CHARNAME>. But I know that you will succeed if you really put your heart to it.~
@6819 = ~That makes two of us then. Few good deities would accept a tiefling follower - actually I doubt that any of them would.~
@6820 = ~Hah! Sune only accepts those who are pleasant to the eyes and easy on the ears.~
@6821 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I would not worship a Lord of Murder or anyone taking his place.~
@6822 = ~So, now I'm in the same category with werewolves?~

@6824 = ~No, Helm would not watch kindly at my presence. Chaos is an inseparable part of my nature and Helm is the god of perfect order.~
@6825 = ~No, I respect your choice, but the Stormkeeper is not someone I would wish to bind myself to.~
@6826 = ~I see. I guess that I was right, then.~
@6827 = ~I see. I guess that you are right, then.~
@6828 = ~Taking into account everything that has happened lately, would you still say that you are happy, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb209]
@6829 = ~Yes, I would. I have lost much, but there is also so much that I would not have experienced without suffering those losses.~
@6830 = ~I-I don't know. How exactly can do you define happiness?~
@6831 = ~No, not really. There is so much I need to achieve before I can feel happy.~
@6832 = ~Uh-oh... That is rather an abrupt question, don't you think. I think I will need some time to think about it.~
@6833 = ~I am glad to hear that you have not lost your optimism despite all the hardships you have faced. And I very much share your view.~
@6834 = ~Well, I am not sure that it is something you can ever define, but on the other hand, I don't think that it needs to be defined. After all, feelings are by nature subjective, and I would wager that most people have at least a vague idea of what *they think* being happy means.~
@6835 = ~I suppose it could be just feeling good about yourself and where you are in life. I guess it is pretty much a state of mind, something to be found within. The fact that most people spend all their lives trying to find happiness in outside things, material or otherwise seems to me rather ironic.~
@6836 = ~But why? What is it that you do not have and that prevents you from enjoying the very moment you are living in? You are the master of your own life just as the rest of us. At least that is what I firmly believe.~
@6837 = ~I guess that to me, happiness stems basically from the knowledge that I can be whatever I want to be and there is nothing in this world that can force me into some predetermined form. That knowledge gives me much of the comfort that I see as one of the preconditions of happiness.~
@6838 = ~This is not the first time you say that. What makes you think that we are in control of our own fates?~
@6839 = ~I am not so sure that I agree. I, for one, obviously do have a destiny which is at least partly beyond my control. Or how else would you explain everything that has passed?~
@6840 = ~You are wrong, Amber. People do have destinies and mine is to inherit my father's legacy. It is that simple.~
@6841 = ~I do not know for sure. Sometimes it just feels like my path is laid before me and there is nothing I can do about it.~
@6842 = ~I really wish that's the case. Unfortunately there really is no way to find out for sure.~
@6843 = ~That's what I try to think. Sometimes it's just hard to ignore the fact that some things seem to be something more than mere chance.~
@6844 = ~But do you not understand? I simply have to believe what I said. I am a demon by virtue of my blood, and if I have a destiny that is tied to my heritage, how can it be anything else than one of murder and lies. I cannot accept such a fate and thus I have no option but to deny it altogether.~
@6845 = ~It is a pity that you have to cling so desperately to a belief like that.~
@6846 = ~You might just as well accept your fate, much as I have to.~
@6847 = ~I don't really care one way or another. Time will tell your true nature, I suppose.~
@6848 = ~But if you really believe in what you say, why do you keep chewing it over? It makes you sound as if you're doubting your own words.~
@6849 = ~I do understand you. It's not like I believe in destiny either.~
@6850 = ~So you pity me? I have no need for your or anyone else's pity. Just think of yourself for a moment! A child of a dead god - of the Lord of Murder, no less. It is me that should be pitying you.~
@6851 = ~No, you are just foolish to think so. I am not a slave to the demonic nature of my kin. I am not! There is no set path for me or you: we are what we make of ourselves.~
@6852 = ~You say that you don't care? But you still admit that you see me as an evil demonspawn?~
@6853 = ~How dare you presume to know how I feel? Why don't you just be honest and say that *you* doubt my words.~
@6854 = ~Do you even realise what it feels like when you think so little of me? That I'm just the offspring of some demon and thus bound to the nature of those beasts. Do you really think that I have no will of my own? If so, shouldn't you be bound to become a murdering lunatic no matter what you do or want?~ [m#amb210]
@6855 = ~My father was no lunatic and I shall rise to become even greater a force than he ever was, remember you that.~
@6856 = ~Don't put *your* words into my mouth, Amber. That is not what I meant.~
@6857 = ~Are you deliberately trying to pick a fight? Is it that time of the month already?~
@6858 = ~You are just unbelievable. I will not speak one more word about this - or anything else for that matter - before you apologise to me.~ [m#amb211]
@6859 = ~I don't think that you really do, <CHARNAME>. How could you. You have only known about your father for such a short time that you can't possibly know what it feels like in the long run.~
@6860 = ~Everyone taking you for something that you're not, casting you into a certain mould, complete with all the nasty details, just because they think that they recognise you for something they think they know.~
@6861 = ~All right, why don't you just take a deep breath and calm down.~
@6862 = ~Don't you patronise me! You may have a lunatic god for a father, but that doesn't mean you can tell me what to do!~
@6863 = ~That's not what I meant. Please don't blow this thing out of proportion.~
@6864 = ~<CHARNAME>? I want to talk to you about something.~ [m#amb212]
@6865 = ~So, you are talking to me again? Does this mean that you are ready to apologise for your behaviour?~
@6866 = ~Oh, I am so glad you have put our little argument behind you. What is it, Amber?~
@6867 = ~Well, I would prefer if you would not. Talk to me, that is. Ever.~
@6868 = ~Me? Apologise? I would just like point out that it should be *you* begging for my forgiveness.~ [m#amb213]
@6869 = ~Our 'little argument'? You insult me in the worst possible way and dare to call it a 'little argument'?~ [m#amb214]
@6870 = ~And how dare you suggest that I would have forgiven you? Not before I hear you beg! And even then I would not bet on it if I were you!~ [m#amb215]
@6871 = ~As you wish... In that case I should leave altogether. You know, for a moment I really thought that we had something special going on here. I guess that I was horribly wrong.~
@6872 = ~Yes, leave. I am tired of your company anyway.~
@6873 = ~No, don't leave, Amber. I still value you as a travelling companion even if things did not work out between us on a personal level.~
@6874 = ~No, you got it all wrong... Did I say ever? For now, that is what I meant. I still need some time to think... about us.~
@6875 = ~So, I was right after all... You only sought someone to warm your bed for a night. How typical. Very well, I will stay for now, but do not be surprised if I leave you when ever it happens to suit me - just as you did to me.~
@6876 = ~Maybe you should also think more about how you say things. No wonder just about everyone tries to kill you if you always express yourself so inaccurately.~
@6877 = ~This has gone too far, <CHARNAME>. It is plain childish to keep up the silent treatment like this - we need to put an end to this foolishness.~ [m#amb220]
@6878 = ~Well, it will not be a long conversation. I have decided that being in a relationship is way too much trouble for someone in my position.~
@6879 = ~I really don't even know what went wrong, but I wish we could put all this behind us.~
@6880 = ~I'm sorry about all the things I said. I didn't mean for you to take my words the way you did, but I do admit that I could have chosen them more carefully.~
@6881 = ~I should have guessed that you were a coward! If that's how you feel, I see no reason to stay in this party any longer.~
@6882 = ~No, I still need you as an ally. You should stay.~
@6883 = ~Then what are you still doing here? And for the record: I'm not a coward.~
@6884 = ~Very well, I will stay for now. But as to for how long, I cannot give you any guarantees.~
@6885 = ~Dream on. I will not waste another moment in your pitiful company. So long, and don't expect to see me again.~
@6886 = ~In my book you are and always will be, <CHARNAME>. So long, and don't expect to see me again.~
@6887 = ~To be honest, I really can't either. And I agree that it would be best for the both of us to just forget what happened and try to be more considerate towards each other in the future.~
@6888 = ~Well, to be fair, I could have been more thoughtful myself. I guess I was just being rather more sensitive than usual.~
@6889 = ~A kiss to make it better, <CHARNAME>? (Amber wraps her arms around your neck and tilts her head back, inviting you to kiss her.)~ [m#amb217]
@6890 = ~Well, kiss and make up, as they say. (Lean in to kiss her.) ~
@6891 = ~I am glad that we sorted this mess out, but I really don't think that we have time for cuddling right now.~
@6892 = ~Why don't we just change that to 'make out' while we are at it, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb218]
@6893 = ~A spoilsport, that's what you are, <CHARNAME>. (Despite your best efforts to resist, Amber manages to steal a quick kiss from you.)~ [m#amb219]
@6894 = ~Mmmm... The smell of the ocean breeze. To me there has always been something sad about the smell of the sea, the cries of the gulls and the crashing of waves on the shore. Have you ever felt the same way?~ [m#amb221]
@6895 = ~Erm... All I can smell is dead fish and all I can hear is the schreeching of those damn birds... The only sad thing about them is that I can barely hear my own thoughts.~
@6896 = ~Yes, I think there are few things in this world more melancholy than the ceaseless sighing of the sea.~
@6897 = ~I have never paid much attention to them, but now that you mention it... Yes, there is a certain air of sadness about them.~
@6898 = ~I think not - to me the sounds and smells of the sea have always represented something new and exciting.~
@6899 = ~Not much of a romantic, are you? Well, I suppose that someone in your situation cannot afford to be too sentimental.~
@6900 = ~I wonder if it's just something we have been conditioned to feel by the armies of poets who have written countless sad and longing verses about the sea. Or is it somehow a feeling that we all naturally share?~
@6901 = ~That's certainly one way of seeing it. I must admit that I find your optimism inspiring, <CHARNAME>.~
@6902 = ~Although I do enjoy the sounds and smells of the sea, I like to keep my feet on dry land. When I'm onboard a ship, I always find the depths below a bit frightening.~
@6903 = ~Frightening? I thought you weren't scared of anything.~
@6904 = ~Well, I have noticed that you are not necessarily as brave as you let people understand.~
@6905 = ~Well, I'll have to say that I share that sentiment. Never had a much of a stomach for the sea.~
@6906 = ~Although I do enjoy the sounds and smells of the sea, I'd like to keep my feet on dry land from now on. When I'm onboard a ship, I always find the depths below a bit frightening.~
@6907 = ~Well, you will come to notice that there are things that...~ [m#amb222]
@6908 = ~I see you have learned to know me well. Though there are things that worry me more than the sea...~ [m#amb223]
@6909 = ~I take it, then, that I can trust you to keep us on dry land for as long as it's possible? It's good to know that there is one less thing that I have to worry about...~ [m#amb224]
@6910 = ~Never mind. I should not depress you with my ramblings. Let's get going.~ [m#amb225]
@6911 = ~<CHARNAME>, what is it that you really want? I mean when all this comes to an end - when we find Irenicus and get your soul back and everything...  is resolved. What then? What is it that you are looking forward to?~ [m#amb226]
@6912 = ~Well, I just hope that you will be there with me, no matter where my life takes me.~
@6913 = ~I seek to inherit my father's legacy. I would not settle for anything less.~
@6914 = ~Amber, it is pretty much impossible for me to make any plans for the future. I will just have to live one day at a time, taking things as they come.~
@6915 = ~I am glad to hear that, but you are avoiding my question. What is it that you see us doing? Adventuring on the road until our feet will no longer carry us?~
@6916 = ~Or is it godhood that you seek? The fulfilment of your destiny? I am not sure I could follow you on that road, but I would like to know, if that is the road you intend to pursue.~
@6917 = ~I must be honest with you, Amber. I cannot deny that my destiny is to embrace the power of my father. I just know it to be so.~
@6918 = ~Amber, I often have no idea even of where I will next lay my head down. It would be useless to make plans for the future. I shall just take things as they come.~
@6919 = ~No, my dreams are much simpler. What I really dream of is a home; a real home with a real family - hopefully with you.~
@6920 = ~I have hardly dreamed of such things...~ [m#amb227]
@6921 = ~No, don't get me wrong. There has just never before been a time when such things seemed possible. I am not sure if they are any more so now, but  I suppose time will tell. However, I am not going to allow myself  such dreams just yet, if you don't mind. Not while everything still seems to be hanging on the edge of a knife.~ [m#amb228]
@6922 = ~I guess that is to be expected. Who would not wish to become a god? Except for me of course. I get enough negative attention as it is - becoming the Lord of Murder reborn would be one of the few things that could make me worse off in that respect.~ [m#amb229]
@6923 = ~But you should not let me keep you from fulfilling your desires. You are free to make whatever you please of your life. I do not believe that anyone's destiny is set in stone before they carve it out themselves. You should remember that.~ [m#amb230]
@6924 = ~Well, that is pretty much the way I have been living my whole life. It is not a bad way to live, but I hope that I will get to share my unplanned future with you.~ [m#amb231]
@6925 = ~A moment of your time, love?~
@6926 = ~Of course, Amber. What is it?~
@6927 = ~I am afraid we do not have time for this right now. Can it wait for later?~
@6928 = ~All right, <CHARNAME>. I will wait for a better time.~ [m#amb232]
@6929 = ~I have been thinking of what we spoke about the future.~ [m#amb233]
@6930 = ~I just want to say that I wish to remain by your side for as long as possible. I just don't want to think of tomorrow and the possibility of losing you.~ [m#amb234]
@6931 = ~Losing you to death or to the gods,  or having you just wither away, should we fail to catch up with Irenicus. Let us just embrace what we have and live our lives  like there is no tomorrow.~ [m#amb185]
@6932 = ~No, don't say anything, love. Please...~ [m#amb235]
@6933 = ~ <CHARNAME>, you do know that I love you, don't you?~ [m#amb236]
@6934 = ~That's hardly news. It would not be the first time someone wants my head on a plate.~
@6935 = ~That's certainly interesting, usually everyone is after <CHARNAME>.~
@6936 = ~'Wanted:  <PLAYER2>, a known associate of the dangerous individual known as <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep.' Then they go on to give details about where you and <CHARNAME> have been seen last, and finally the reward. Wow, not half bad... I think I've seen one of these before, but I didn't really pay much attention to it then.~
@6937 = ~I wonder why they chose such a peculiar turn of phrase. 'Straight, shoulder length brown hair" would have been clear enough. Sheesh, it is a bounty notice and not a romance novel, after all.~
@6938 = ~Well, I'm not going to ask how and when you got it, all right? I don't really want to know. ~
@6939 = ~I wonder who is it that they are describing, since you're certainly not a woman, and besides, <CHARNAME> is not exactly a woman's name. Or is there something about you I should know?~
@6940 = ~I can take the first watch, <CHARNAME>,  but would you care to sit with me for a while?~
@6941 = ~I have always loved the night and the stars - whenever I was sad or frightened as a kid, I looked up to the heavens for comfort. Stars are so beautiful and tranquil...~
@6942 = ~(Sensing your apprehension, Amber shifts her balance and pulls away from you. Before you realise what has happened, she is on her feet and climbing down the rock.) I think it would be best if you went to sleep already. I have taken enough time off your rest as it is. I will go and make a few rounds around the camp to see that there are no animals that could steal our food. Good night.~
@6943 = ~Your concern is touching <CHARNAME>, but I am fine, really. Although it *would* be a embarrassing end - to be mortally wounded by a rose bush.~
@6944 = ~(As you are about to leave the common room to go to bed, Amber, who has been sitting on the other side of the room gets up and approaches you.) <CHARNAME>, wait. I-I was wondering if you would mind... if I could... come up to your room for a while. We could talk and maybe... (Her voice trails off.)~ [m#amb176]
@6945 = ~Um, on second thought, I am not sure this is such a good idea after all. I am happy that we have grown more close lately, but I would not want to ruin it by getting into a situation I am not ready for. I hope you understand me, Amber.~
@6946 = ~(Amber draws closer, takes a hold of your hands and places them on her body. You can feel every curve of her toned figure and the heat that emanates from within her. You cannot help but marvel at the way her body feels -  so fragile and yet so strong...)~
@6947 = ~...awkward and weird.~ [m#amb188]
@6948 = ~ Well, one thing I am definitely *not* looking for in a woman are these endless questions. Would a moment of peace once in a while be too much to ask?~
@6949 = ~Now don't you try avoiding my question with another one. I do not mean to trap you or anything, I just want an honest answer, not something you think might please me.~
@6950 = ~The only thing about the gods that I am interested in is <CHARNAME> and <PRO_HISHER> father's legacy.~
@6951 = ~No, I don't think that the gods have anything to offer to me.~
@6952 = ~Well, if  <CHARNAME> ever comes to inherit <PRO_HISHER> father's legacy, you could become <PRO_HISHER> follower.~
@6953 = ~I see. It is all about power and destiny to you. That path is not going to be an easy one to follow, <CHARNAME>. Neither for you nor for <CHARNAME>. But I know that you will succeed if you really put your heart into it.~
@6954 = ~Well, if <CHARNAME> ever comes to inherit <PRO_HISHER> father's legacy, you could become <PRO_HISHER> follower.~
@6955 = ~Hah! Sune only accepts those who are pleasant to the eyes and easy on the ears. ~
@6956 = ~Yes, I would. I have seen much pain travelling with <CHARNAME>, but there is also so much that I would not have experienced had I not chosen to stay with <PRO_HIMHER> through all that has happened.~
@6957 = ~I am glad to hear that you have not lost your optimism despite all the hardships you have faced alongside <CHARNAME>. And I very much share your view.~
@6958 = ~I am not so sure that I agree. <CHARNAME>, for one, obviously does have a destiny which is at least partly beyond <PRO_HISHER> control. Or how else would you explain everything that has passed?~
@6959 = ~You are wrong, Amber. People do have destinies. The destiny of <CHARNAME>, for example, is to inherit <PRO_HISHER> father's legacy. It is that simple.~
@6960 = ~I wish it to be true. Unfortunately there really is no way to find out for sure.~
@6961 = ~You might just as well accept your fate, much as we all have to.~
@6962 = ~So you pity me? I have no need for your or anyone else's pity. Just think of yourself for a moment! A sidekick to the child of a dead god - of the Lord of Murder, no less. It is me that should be pitying you.~
@6963 = ~Do you even realise what it feels like when you think so little of me? That I'm just the offspring of some demon and thus bound to the nature of those beasts. Do you really think that I have no will of my own? If so, shouldn't <CHARNAME> be bound to become a murdering lunatic no matter what <PRO_HESHE> does or wants?~
@6964 = ~<CHARNAME>'s father was no lunatic and <PRO_HESHE> shall rise to become even greater a force than he ever was, remember you that. And when that happens, *I* will be the one to take my place by <PRO_HISHER> side as <PRO_HISHER> most trusted companion.~
@6965 = ~<CHARNAME>, what is it that you really want? I mean when all this comes to an end - when we find Irenicus and <CHARNAME> gets <PRO_HISHER> soul back and everything...  is resolved. What then? What is it that you are looking forward to?~ [m#amb201]
@6966 = ~I will make sure that <CHARNAME> inherits <PRO_HISHER> father's legacy and that I will be there to take my place by <PRO_HISHER> side - I would not settle for anything less.~
@6967 = ~Or is the destiny of <CHARNAME> all you can think of?~
@6968 = ~I must be honest with you, Amber. I cannot deny that it is my intent to see that <CHARNAME> embraces the power of <PRO_HISHER> father.~
@6969 = ~I guess that is to be expected. Who would not wish to see someone become a god? Except for me of course. I get enough negative attention as it is - becoming an acolyte to the Lord of Murder reborn would be one of the few things that could make me worse off in that respect.~
@6970 = ~I have been thinking of what we spoke about the future.~
@6971 = ~I just want to say that I wish to remain by your side for as long as possible. I just don't want to think of  tomorrow and the possibility of losing you.~ [m#amb234]
@6972 = ~ Losing you to death, or to this epic quest that was forced upon <CHARNAME> when Irenicus stole <PRO_HISHER> soul. I know that you'll follow <PRO_HIMHER> wherever this might take you, and I also know that I will do the same for you.  Let us just embrace what we have and live our lives  like there is no tomorrow.~
@6973 = ~This might sound a bit blunt to you, but how does it feel? Having no soul?~ [m#amb237]
@6974 = ~Actually, I am surprised that I really do not feel any different. At all.~
@6975 = ~I do not wish to discuss this with you Amber. You could never understand.~
@6976 = ~ That's peculiar. I would have imagined it to well... never mind. They say that demons have no souls - sometimes I wonder if I have one. But I guess that would be of little interest you now. We should focus on getting yours back instead. But if you ever want to talk about your soul, just let me know.~
@6977 = ~You would be surprised to learn just how much I do understand. But have it your way then and bottle everything inside your little head. If you ever want to talk about your soul, just let me know.~
@6978 = ~You would be surprised to learn just how much I do understand. But have it your way then and bottle everything inside your little head. If you ever want to talk about your soul, just let me know. ~
@6979 = ~You know that your sister Imoen is suffering from this, don't you? I did not know her before her soul was taken away, but I can see the void it has left in her. You should try to comfort her. And if *you* want to talk about it, you can trust me to listen.~
@6980 = ~Whoa... <CHARNAME>! It's you! I... How did you manage to sneak upon me like that? Or more importantly, *why*?~ [m#amb238]
@6981 = ~I... I've gotten too used to being at ease lately. In a different situation, such carelessness could have cost me my life. And I think it's because of you that I have grown so dangerously comfortable, <CHARNAME>. Although I'm not sure whether it's a good thing or a bad thing.~
@6982 = ~Well, it *is* just me this time. You can put the blade away. And besides, I don't think you'd need it anyway - most attackers would probably drop their weapons out of sheer surprise.~
@6983 = ~What was that tune you were humming? I don't think that I have ever heard it before.~
@6984 = ~Oh, I get the hint. I am sorry for having disturbed your bath.~
@6985 = ~Amber - it is cold here and you are shivering. Would you mind if I- ~
@6986 = ~I would be surprised if you had... It was first sung by someone very dear to me - a very long time ago.~
@6987 = ~And who would that someone be? Another man in your past I have not heard of?~
@6988 = ~It is a beautiful tune. I think you should sing it more often.~
@6989 = ~No, and even if there was another man, what would it be to you? Would it matter? My friend has been dead for ages and you have the nerve to be jealous? It is just a tune I like to hum while taking a bath - and I don't expect anyone to hear me then.~
@6990 = ~I can hardly sing... My musical ambitions are strictly limited to humming in the bath - and I expect there to be no-one listening to me while doing so.~
@6991 = ~Do not worry about it. I will see you back at the camp soon, dear. And don't you go falling asleep just yet... This water is quite chilly and I will be expecting you to warm my cold feet.~
@6992 = ~No.~
@6993 = ~I would not mind if you... would warm me. (You reach for the towel Amber has left on the bank, wrap it around her and pull her close to you. As she looks up to you, her eyes tell you that she is no longer shivering from the cold.)~
@6994 = ~Well, *you* did look like you'd just seen a cow jump over the moon. And it's not like you hadn't seen me naked before, either. I guess I did make an impression, then. (Amber flashes you a teasing smile as she puts the sword away.)~
@6995 = ~I'd better get dressed now before I catch a cold out here. I will see you back at the camp soon, dear. And don't you go falling asleep just yet...  I will want to see whether I can make an impression on you *without* the surprise element.~
@6996 = ~<CHARNAME>, Veldrin... I have been looking at you after we... um ...changed. You don't look bad at all, my darling. In fact, I find your dark skin and drow features quite... attractive. Of course it is only because I know it is you under those features, but still...~ [m#amb240]
@6997 = ~(Amber leans closer to you as she speaks, reaching to caress your cheek and pointed ears with her dark skinned hand. Amber presses her body against yours and her other hand slides down your back until she is gently fondling your buttocks.)~
@6998 = ~Now, male... You have made quite an impression on me lately and I wish to reward your efforts. To my chambers then, Veldrin.~ [m#amb241]
@6999 = ~Eh, are you certain that this is right time for this... Hey, watch that hand!~
@7000 = ~Hmm... You're not looking half bad yourself, my dear. Perhaps we *should* retire to your room...~
@7001 = ~Ack! You are sick, you know that... I find this form most unpleasant and I have no desire to... to sleep with you while you look like one of those monsters.~
@7002 = ~Don't be such a bore, my Veldrin. Certainly a male as powerful as yourself is worthy of my affections.~
@7003 = ~(Amber smiles coyly, but as she sees your reaction, her face quickly turns more serious as she whispers to you.)  No, I see that you're not enjoying yourself. I am sorry <CHARNAME>. I was just trying to lighten the mood; it is so depressing here, with all the hostility and anger everywhere.~
@7004 = ~And really, I have been missing your touch on my skin. We have had so precious little time to ourselves lately. But I was being tasteless and gross, and I do apologise for that.~
@7005 = ~But mistress - it is I who should apologise for forgetting my position... An unworthy male like myself should get whipped for ignoring your wishes. (Give Amber a wink.)~
@7006 = ~No need to apologise, but it was a bit tacky to tell you the truth.~
@7007 = ~Don't you ever attempt something like that again. It was really unpleasant.~
@7008 = ~(The real drow pay little attention to you and Amber as she quite literally drags you to her bedchambers. The only reaction is a few envious looks from the male patrons.)~
@7009 = ~So, you find these dark, exotic drow women attractive, do you? Well, I have to admit that I, too, find dark skin and drow features quite... attractive.~ [m#amb242]
@7010 = ~(Amber leans closer to you as she speaks, tracing your jawline with her hand. Her ebony-skinned body grazes against yours as her other hand slides down your back until it suddenly grasps your buttocks.)~
@7011 = ~But do not presume to forget who is your true mistress, male...~ [m#amb243]
@7012 = ~Now then, it seems I will need to discipline you for your forgetfulness.~ [m#amb244]
@7013 = ~Wh- What do you mean... Hey, watch that hand!~
@7014 = ~Cut it out. I was only playing along to keep her from realising who we really are.~
@7015 = ~I am sorry, my mistress. I am but a lowly male and should be whipped into obedience.~
@7016 = ~Don't try to act innocent to me, Veldrin. I heard your little exchange with Phaere. Would you really wish her to be your mistress instead of me?~
@7017 = ~But I was only playing along to keep her from realising that we're not really drow.~
@7018 = ~No! I don't know what got into me. I promise you it won't happen again.~
@7019 = ~I'm sorry Amber. I guess I just got a little carried away. I promise you it won't happen again.~
@7020 = ~Well, I guess I just couldn't help myself. She is a very sensual woman and it was obvious that she was coming on to me.~
@7021 = ~I am sorry, my mistress. I am but a lowly male who forgot his place and should be whipped into obedience.~
@7022 = ~Yeah, right. As if I didn't see it was you who was drooling over her, and quite of your own initiative, I might add. That kind of assertiveness is hardly expected of a drow male.~
@7023 = ~I know and I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me. I promise you it won't happen again.~
@7024 = ~Well, I guess I just couldn't help myself. You'll have to admit that she *is* a very sensual woman. And it's not as if she wasn't interested.~
@7025 = ~Oh, I will make sure that you'll learn your lesson. And when I'm through with you, you will never want to look at other women again.~
@7026 = ~Oh, you can be sure it won't. Perhaps I will need to educate you on the benefits of remaining faithful.~
@7027 = ~And that's what happens every time you imagine an attractive woman showing the least bit of interest in you? If that is the case, perhaps you should just go with that she-spider and see what she thinks of that.~
@7028 = ~Well, maybe I should. I am sure she would at least make a lot more exciting bedmate.~
@7029 = ~I'm sorry, Amber. I admit that I was being inappropriate, and I will try to behave from now on.~
@7030 = ~Why don't you just do that, then. I'll find my own way out of this place.~
@7031 = ~Well, you'd better. I'll leave you to it.~
@7032 = ~(Amber turns and climbs up to her own room. Somehow you get the feeling that you will be spending the night alone.)~
@7033 = ~Cut it out. I already told you I was only playing along to keep her from realising who we really are.~
@7034 = ~Don't try to act innocent to me, Veldrin. I have not forgotten your little exchange with Phaere. Would you really wish her to be your mistress instead of me?~
@7035 = ~(Amber smiles wickedly, but as she sees your reaction, her face quickly turns more serious as she whispers to you.) No, I see that you're not enjoying yourself. I am sorry <CHARNAME>. I admit that seeing you with Phaere made me jealous, but I should not take it on you like this.~
@7036 = ~You had a bad dream last night, didn't you <CHARNAME>? You were keeping everyone awake with your groaning. I did not dare to wake you, though.~ [m#amb250]
@7037 = ~Well, I guess I did. I am sorry to have kept you from resting; next time I make a scene while sleeping, you just give me a kick, OK? ~
@7038 = ~I- I think that I would like to have some privacy, now. My dream was... disturbing. I have to think about it.~
@7039 = ~I am glad that it was just a dream and that I woke up with you, Amber.~
@7040 = ~I don't think that you should worry your pretty little head about me grunting a few times in my sleep.~
@7041 = ~I think not, <CHARNAME>. Dreams are not meaningless and if I disturb your nightly visions, how can you ever understand them?~
@7042 = ~I understand... I was just hoping that I could be there when you needed me. But I suppose that giving you space when you need it is one way of showing that I care.~
@7043 = ~Just a dream? You can always say that, but it certainly sounded a lot more serious than that.~
@7044 = ~Well, maybe I shouldn't worry my pretty little head - as you so elegantly put it - about you squealing like a stuck pig in your sleep, but in that case you could also turn your volume down a bit.~
@7045 = ~(Amber hurries to your side and her face turns ghostly pale as she realises the seriousness of your injuries.)~
@7046 = ~<CHARNAME>, you're hurt!~ [m#amb251]
@7047 = ~You... you do have a spell to heal yourself with, don't you, <CHARNAME>? At least a minor one, so that we can move you to somewhere more safe where we can properly tend to your wounds.~ [m#amb252]
@7048 = ~Nghh... yeah, I do. I think I can do something about these wounds...~
@7049 = ~Ngrr... I do, but I think... I think I can just ride this one through without one.~
@7050 = ~Nghh... No, I have used everything already...~
@7051 = ~Don't be silly, <CHARNAME> - you are hurt and you need help. If you will not help yourself, I will have to ask someone else to help you.~
@7052 = ~Very well, I will heal myself if that makes you feel better.~
@7053 = ~I already said I can do without, Amber.~
@7054 = ~You men are all the same... I will not let you get yourself killed because of your silly machismo.~
@7055 = ~Quickly, someone come and help!~ [m#amb253]
@7056 = ~I'll ask if <PLAYER2> can help.~
@7057 = ~Jaheira! Now would be a good time to put your experience to use! <CHARNAME> needs your help!~
@7058 = ~Aerie! <CHARNAME> needs your help! Come quickly!~
@7059 = ~Cernd! <CHARNAME> is in dire need of your healing skills! Please, hurry up!~
@7060 = ~Viconia! Make yourself useful for once and help <CHARNAME>!~
@7061 = ~There is no time for this now, Viconia! You do not want to have the death of <CHARNAME> on your conscience, do you? Do something! Please?~
@7062 = ~Anomen! If you want to be useful just for once in your life, come and help <CHARNAME>!~
@7063 = ~This is not the time or the place for venting personal animosities, Anomen. <CHARNAME> is hurt and needs your help, now!~
@7064 = ~Just hold on, <CHARNAME>. I-I should have a potion here somewhere...~ [m#amb254]
@7065 = ~<PLAYER2>! <CHARNAME> is in dire need of your healing skills!~
@7066 = ~Please, hurry!~
@7067 = ~Calm down, Amber. I think I can cure some of his wounds.~
@7068 = ~Calm down, Amber. He'll be just fine, even without my help.~
@7069 = ~I'm afraid that I have already spent all my powers. I really cannot do anything to help him.~
@7070 = ~Thank you <PLAYER2>.~
@7071 = ~Fine, have it your way. Just don't expect me to help you when you need it.~
@7072 = ~Doesn't anyone here have any healing powers left?~
@7073 = ~You look tired, dear. Maybe we should call it a day and find someplace to rest. It won't do you any good going on without proper sleep.~ [m#amb255]
@7074 = ~So, how about it, <CHARNAME>?~
@7075 = ~You are right, Amber. We should already stop to rest. I am glad that you are here to watch out for me - to keep me from exhausting myself to death in this mad pursuit.~
@7076 = ~Stop pampering me, Amber. I'm well capable of taking care of myself.~
@7077 = ~I wish we could... But not now. What we are doing here is too important for us to be wasting our time.~
@7078 = ~A decent inn should not be too hard to find, right?~
@7079 = ~I bet we could find a corner that's safe enough and not too damp, if getting out of this hole is not an option.~
@7080 = ~I would prefer a bed over sleeping on the ground, but I'm sure we can find a decent campsite somewhere nearby.~
@7081 = ~And you probably would, were I not here to see that you stop to eat and rest once in a while.~
@7082 = ~I have to disagree, <CHARNAME>... You're already so tired that you don't even realise it. And I'd bet that you are also a bit hungry, since you are all grumpy again.~
@7083 = ~I agree that what we are doing here is of great importance. But I also think that if something is that vital, one should not ruin it by trying to tackle it while tired and hungry.~
@7084 = ~Anyway, I trust that we will get some rest soon. I can see if I can get us something to eat, so you don't have to worry about that.~ [m#amb256]
@7085 = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm sorry. I never properly thanked you for saving my life. And not just my life but everything I am, my soul, my self... Thank you, I shall never forget what you did. No matter what happens to us.~ [m#amb146]
@7086 = ~I would not hesitate to do it all over again. I - I just hope that there is still an 'us'; you sounded so upset the last time we spoke in the temple.~
@7087 = ~Don't mention it. I trust that you would have done the same for me. And I do hope that the 'us' you mentioned is a long term arrangement. ~
@7088 = ~It's about time you realised that, but for your information: I'm not so sure if there really is an 'us'.~
@7089 = ~Of course there is an 'us' if I have any say in the matter. I am sorry for what happened in the temple. It was just so horrible - you cannot even imagine.~ [m#amb147]
@7090 = ~Or, maybe you can... You did have your soul ripped out and became the Slayer. That must have been equally unpleasant, if not worse.~ [m#amb148]
@7091 = ~(Amber puts her arms around you and buries her face in your chest. Her tiny body is shaking all over and she sounds like she is desperately trying to hold back tears.) But you cope with it so well... I-I don't know if I c-can.~
@7092 = ~(Hold Amber gently.) Amber, it's all right to cry. It will make you feel better, trust me.~
@7093 = ~(Push Amber away.) Ack... Amber, if you're going to get all teary-eyed, do it against someone else's shoulder, will you.~
@7094 = ~You... you would deny me even a little bit of comfort? I thought you more caring than that. It seems that I was wrong.~ [m#amb150]
@7095 = ~(You hold Amber close until her sobbing subsides and she rests easy in your arms. Finally she raises her head and looks deep into your eyes.)  <CHARNAME>... Thank you for understanding; it means the world to me. I feel blessed beyond belief for having found someone as gentle and caring as you.~ [m#amb151]
@7096 = ~Oh, Amber... now you're making me cry.~
@7097 = ~You can always open your heart to me, Amber. I'll always be there to listen. ~
@7098 = ~We should get going, <CHARNAME>. I see that the others are growing impatient.~
@7099 = ~<CHARNAME>, I have been looking at you after we... um ...changed. You don't look bad at all, my darling. In fact, I find your dark skin and drow features quite... attractive. Of course it is only because I know it is you under those features, but still...~ [m#amb239]
@7100 = ~Now, male... You have made quite an impression on me lately and I wish to reward your efforts. To my chambers then.~ [m#amb193]
@7101 = ~Don't be such a bore, my <CHARNAME>. Certainly a male as powerful as yourself is worthy of my affections.~
@7102 = ~I'll ask if <CHARNAME> can help.~
@7103 = ~There is no time for this now, Viconia! You do not want to have the death of <PLAYER2> on your conscience, do you? Do something! Please?~
@7104 = ~This is not the time or the place for venting personal animosities, Anomen. <PLAYER2> is hurt and needs your help, now!~
@7105 = ~Just hold on, <PLAYER2>. I-I should have a potion here somewhere...~ [m#amb254]
@7106 = ~<CHARNAME>! <PLAYER2> is in dire need of your healing skills!~
@7107 = ~Thank you <CHARNAME>.~
@7108 = ~You look tired, dear. Maybe we should call it a day and ask <CHARNAME> if we could set up camp. It won't do you any good going on without proper sleep.~
@7109 = ~No, it is for <CHARNAME> to decide when we stop.~
@7110 = ~We won't be of any use to <PRO_HIMHER> if we are dead tired. I would think <PRO_HESHE> understands that.~
@7111 = ~Perhaps. It depends on what you have to say.~ [m#amb114]
@7112 = ~I just want to apologise for overreacting. You just caught me off guard and I did not quite know how to react. I am not used to people touching me, you see... Especially not people like you... A-as attractive as you, I mean.~
@7113 = ~I just want to apologise for overreacting. I am just not used to people touching me and you just startled me. Sometimes I have trouble letting my guard down, even among close friends.~
@7114 = ~I have thought about it, and I think that we would be better off without such intimacies. I like you as a friend and ally, but I think such displays of affection are beyond the scope of our relationship, both now and in the future.~
@7115 = ~I have considered the matter and I have come to the conclusion that you were totally out of line. I do not want anyone touching me, and for breaking that rule I must insist that you leave, Amber. Now. I simply cannot tolerate this kind of behaviour from my underlings.~
@7116 = ~Wha...?~
@7117 = ~What I was trying to say was that I really don't have anything against you touching me, and I hope that you can just forget my earlier reaction and err... maybe consider doing it again some time...~
@7118 = ~Oh, I am sorry... I did not mean to embarrass you. I just hope that you can forget that the incident ever happened. Could you do that?~
@7119 = ~Do not worry about it. Your apology is accepted and I am happy that you told me this. It will be a lot less awkward if I do not have to take care not to touch you. (Amber smiles and squeezes your hand gently.)~
@7120 = ~Um, yes, I guess so. (Amber looks slightly puzzled.) ~
@7121 = ~I thought that might have been the case. I thank you for your apology and feel glad that you count me among your circle of close friends. Perhaps...~
@7122 = ~Hmmm... Never mind, actually.~
@7123 = ~I thought that might have been the case. I thank you for your apology and feel glad that you count me among your circle of close friends.~
@7124 = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>. I did not realise that you are not used to such gestures between friends and allies, but I will try to respect your personal boundaries in the future.~
@7125 = ~What? Have you gone completely out of your mind? First of all, I am *not* your underling, and second, you will not set me rules to live by. If that is how you view your companions, I am more than glad to leave. No need to expect me to come back, either.~
@7126 = ~<CHARNAME>, I think you are taking this a bit too seriously. I'm sorry if I've been giving you the wrong idea, but I simply offered you my friendship. I hope that you were not expecting anything more.~
@7127 = ~Oh, yes, of course. But a friend can be a *dear* friend, right?~
@7128 = ~Err... Of course, that was what I meant, too.~
@7129 = ~Hey, if you think you're too good for me, just forget it. I don't want your friendship.~
@7130 = ~Well, yes, that is possible. Time will tell, I suppose. Let's get going then, friend.~
@7131 = ~OK, just checking. Let's get going then, friend.~
@7132 = ~Well, suit yourself! It seems that you are not worth my friendship, after all.~
@7133 = ~Perhaps. What about it?~ [m#amb115]
@7134 = ~I have given it some serious thought and come to the conclusion that you were right. I guess I was just afraid of the consequences of growing too fond of someone... of you. The thought of once more losing someone dear to me was just too much.~
@7135 = ~I have given it some thought and come to the conclusion that although I think you are right in some respects, my situation simply does not allow for commitments beyond simple comradeship. This does not mean that I am not committed to my friends or do not appreciate their commitment, but that is all I can offer.~
@7136 = ~I thought that it would just be good to clear things up a bit. I do not know what you are used to expecting of your friends, but I do want to point out, that this party has been formed for purely utilitarian purposes and has no room for any sentimental notions whatsoever. You are here to do a job for your share of the profits. Am I making myself clear?~
@7137 = ~I understand what you mean. But it is precisely because I have lost so many dear to me that I am convinced of what I said to you. Opening up your heart so someone always means taking a risk, yes, but to me it has always been one worth taking. Do you think you could find the courage to take that risk , <CHARNAME>?~
@7138 = ~I promise to try, Amber. I promise to try.~
@7139 = ~I truly do not know, Amber. We will just have to wait and see.~
@7140 = ~I am not sure if I want to, Amber. I am afraid I am not in a position to take any unnecessary risks, but I do appreciate you as a friend and an ally, nevertheless.~
@7141 = ~I am sorry to hear that, but I am happy that you can at least see the value of true friendship. Thank you for clearing that up, <CHARNAME>.~
@7142 = ~That is exactly what I've been trying to say all along! It is good to know that you agree and see the value of true friendship.~
@7143 = ~Well, if that is how you want to view your companions, who am I to argue with that. Just do not expect anything more in return.~
@7144 = ~(Amber smiles at you.) I am glad to hear that, <CHARNAME>.~
@7145 = ~Perhaps we should let things take their time, then? I would hate to push you into something you don't want to do.~
@7146 = ~Then friends we shall be.~
@7147 = ~What is it?~ [m#amb164]
@7148 = ~I would just like to apologise for being so rude with you the other night. I know that being tired is not an excuse and I do not know what got into me, but it has been bothering me ever since. Do you think you could forgive me, Amber? It would make me feel so much better.~
@7149 = ~I would like to apologise for being so rude with you the other night. I was just tired and I guess I got scared of giving you the wrong impression and overreacted to the other extreme. What I am trying to tell you is that I like you as a friend and ally, but I do not want to encourage you to think anything else. So, can we just continue our travels as friends?~
@7150 = ~On second thought, never mind. It was nothing.~
@7151 = ~If it bothers you that much, I guess I should let you out of your misery. Let us just put that one down to fatigue then, and forget it. Apology accepted. Just don't make a habit out of it.~
@7152 = ~Well, if that was what you meant to say, you could certainly have put it more nicely. I guess I have no reason not to accept your apology. Just try to be a bit nicer towards your friends in the future. ~
@7153 = ~I must admit I have been waiting for you to say that, but I have to ask you: are you sure? I would not want you to back off at the last moment again.~ [m#amb179]
@7154 = ~Amber, I am not scared of you, I just need to be prepared for things like that; I don't like surprises.~
@7155 = ~Yes I am sure, Amber. You are the most intriguing person I have ever met, and I think we are ready to take our relationship to the next level.~
@7156 = ~On second thought, I don't think that I'm ready for this after all. Try to understand, Amber - it's not that I don't want to be with you, but there's just so much happening in my life that I don't dare to get that close to anyone right now.~
@7157 = ~Well, you should get used to them, because I am full of surprises. (A mischievous smile plays on Amber's lips.) And I am sure most of them are not going to be unpleasant to you, <CHARNAME>. I will let you to take charge this time, though - if you think you are up to it, of course.~ [m#amb180]
@7158 = ~In that case I am all for it, <CHARNAME>. And I thank you for the compliment - I could well say the same of you...~ [m#amb182]
@7159 = ~I have all the time in the world, <CHARNAME>. Well, maybe not all of it, but enough to wait for you for a while anyway.~ [m#amb184]
@7160 = ~I can hardly wait to set up camp, <CHARNAME>. (Amber takes your hand and you walk hand in hand for a good while.)~
@7161 = ~All right. Since you do not seem to have the brains or the guts to explain what you did, I will have to ask you. What in the Nine Hells was that all about?! You walking away from me like that?~ [m#amb195]
@7162 = ~Amber, look. It was fun while it lasted, but don't you think that we should go on our separate paths?~
@7163 = ~I-I don't know. I guess that I got scared... or something.~
@7164 = ~Everything just happened so fast. I just felt that I needed a bit of distance for a while.~
@7165 = ~By the merciful heavens and the hells below! How stupid have I been! Here I thought that you were something special - different from the rest of them. I could not have been more wrong.~ [m#amb196]
@7166 = ~I will not say goodbye, since there is nothing good in this world that I wish for scum like you. I can guarantee that our paths will never cross again, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb197]
@7167 = ~Scared?~ [m#amb198]
@7168 = ~Well, um... Yes. Scared.~
@7169 = ~No, not really scared. Anxious would probably be more accurate. I just don't feel comfortable with this intimacy part of relationships.~
@7170 = ~Amber, look, it was fun while it lasted, but don't you think that we should go on our separate paths?~
@7171 = ~It certainly would have helped had you mentioned such a desire to me. It would have saved a lot of time and effort now wasted on a misunderstanding.~ [m#amb200]
@7172 = ~All right, let's just say that you got *scared*.~
@7173 = ~Well, you certainly had no trouble in getting into the sex part of the relationship.~
@7174 = ~I suppose that the important question is whether you have already had enough of your 'distance' or whether you wish to make it a permanent state of affairs?~
@7175 = ~Yes, I've done some thinking and I just don't see a future for us. It would be better for us to go on our separate paths.~
@7176 = ~I realised that it was a mistake as soon as I had walked away from you. I just did not have the courage to come back. And you have been so mad at me ever since that I did not dare to speak to you.~
@7177 = ~No, I don't want to make it a permanent state of affairs, but let's not rush into things from now on, all right? Let's just take it nice and easy, okay?~
@7178 = ~Don't worry about it, we can take things easy from now on, I can promise you that. But you will have to promise me to try and have a little more faith in me, <CHARNAME>. If you feel there is something - anything - wrong, feel free to share it with me. I wont bite you - at least not too hard.~ [m#amb202]
@7179 = ~Well, at least we have *something* we can agree on. But you are right - we do need to talk.~ [m#amb216]
@7180 = ~Well, at least we have *something* we can agree on. But you are right - we do need to talk.~
@7181 = ~Well, it will not be a long conversation. I have decided that this friendship thing is way too much trouble for someone in my position.~
@7182 = ~<CHARNAME>, may I ask you something? It's a bit personal, but since I am travelling with you, I feel I have the right to know.~ [m#amb139]
@7183 = ~Fine, have it your way, but let's get one thing straight right here and now. There is no such thing as 'the likes of me' and I have no desire to be at the receiving end of your inane generalisations.~
@7184 = ~I'm sorry, I was a bit out of line there. Didn't mean to offend you. Could you just come back with your questions sometime later?~
@7185 = ~My heritage is none of your business. Don't bother me with this again.~
@7186 = ~I would gladly hear it from you instead of getting an exaggerated version from someone else. I'd rather not judge you based on half-whispered rumours and empty speculation about your supposed heritage. I know first hand what that can lead to.~
@7187 = ~Very well. Have you heard of the prophesies orecounting the demise of Bhaal during the Time of Troubles, and the legacy left by him?~
@7188 = ~Yes I have. (Amber's almond-shaped eyes widen a bit.) You're not saying that... you're one of the children?~
@7189 = ~It seems that our friend <CHARNAME> here doesn't consider me worth talking to. Am I to understand that you hold the same opinion of me?~ [m#amb259]
@7190 = ~Well, yes. I really don't think we have anything to say to each other.~
@7191 = ~You know very well that I don't. I just feel uncomfortable talking about other people's personal affairs.~
@7192 = ~Of course not. I just thought that he would rather tell you himself.~
@7193 = ~If that is how you feel, fine. I shall not bother you any more.~ [m#amb260]
@7194 = ~Since I am traveling with you and thus necessarily affected by whatever <CHARNAME> has decided to hide about <PRO_HIMHER>self, I feel I have the right to know what it is. For our mutual safety, if for no other reason.~
@7195 = ~Well, I guess you are right. What exactly was it that you wanted to know?~
@7196 = ~If <CHARNAME> has decided not to answer your questions, it is not for me to question his judgement. You will just have to settle for that.~
@7197 = ~Well, it seems obvious to me that <CHARNAME> is not all <PRO_RACE>, is <PRO_HESHE>? And don't you give me that look. I have gathered enough from the whispers of the people around you and the looks of the commoners that follow <PRO_HIMHER> when we pass by, to realise that there is more to this party than meets the eye.~
@7198 = ~Very well. Have you heard of the prophecies recounting the demise of Bhaal during the Time of Troubles, and the legacy left by him?~
@7199 = ~Yes I have. (Amber's almond-shaped eyes widen a bit.) You're not saying that... <PRO_HESHE> is one of the children?~
@7200 = ~I am afraid that if I am to stay in this party, I must insist. I know that there is something in <PRO_HISHER> heritage that is very likely to place us all in great peril, and if I am to remain in this party and risk my life with the rest of you, I have the right to know exactly what it is.~
@7201 = ~I see. It seems obvious to me that neither of you really wants me in this party. If that is indeed the case, I will not burden you with my presence any longer.~
@7202 = ~Wait. That is not true, at least I do want you to stay. If you feel you really must know, I will answer your question.~
@7203 = ~I have nothing against you staying, and I doubt that <CHARNAME> has either, but you must understand that in this party, we value our privacy. You should therefore not expect us to talk a whole lot.~
@7204 = ~Well, if that is how you feel, it might be for the best.~
@7205 = ~Fine.~
@7206 = ~I have considered the matter and I have come to the conclusion that you were totally out of line. I do not want anyone touching me, and for breaking that rule I must insist that you leave, Amber. Now.~
@7207 = ~What? Have you gone completely out of your mind? First of all, you are in no position to tell me to leave, and second, you will not set me rules to live by. I hope that you have enough sense in you to keep your distance in the future.~
@7208 = ~I just thought that it would be good to clear things up a bit. I do not know what you are used to expecting of your friends, but I do want to point out that I'm in this party for purely utilitarian purposes and there is no room for any sentimental notions whatsoever. We are both here to do a job for our share of the profits. Am I making myself clear?~
@7209 = ~I will not say goodbye, since there is nothing good in this world that I wish for scum like you. I can guarantee that our paths will never cross again, <CHARNAME>.~
@7210 = ~That's peculiar. I would have imagined it to well... never mind. They say that demons have no souls - sometimes I wonder if I have one. But I guess that would be of little interest you now. We should focus on getting yours back instead. But if you ever want to talk about your soul, just let me know.~
@7211 = ~You would be surprised to learn just how much I understand. But have it your way then and bottle everything inside your little head. If you ever want to talk about your soul, just let me know.~
@7212 = ~You would be surprised to learn just how much I understand. But have it your way then and bottle everything inside your little head. If you ever want to talk about your soul, just let me know. ~
@7213 = ~Can I ask you something personal, <CHARNAME>?~
@7214 = ~<CHARNAME>, do you ever think about powers greater than us? Do you ever cry to the gods for help or advice?~ [m#amb208]
@7215 = ~I see. It is all power and godhood for you. That path is not going to be easy one to follow, <CHARNAME>. But I know that you will succeed if you really put your heart to it.~
@7216 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, I would not worship a Lord of Murder or anyone taking his place.~
@7217 = ~I see. I guess the I was right, then.~
@7218 = ~I have been observing how you lead this party, <CHARNAME>, and I must admit that you are not a bad leader at all. I could even go as far as to call you a very good leader, if not an excellent one.~
@7219 = ~To that I am tempted to reply with something that you yourself used to say all the time when we had just met: What do you want of me? Why all this flattery?~
@7220 = ~Thank you Amber. I only strive to do my best.~
@7221 = ~I know that I am an excellent leader, Amber. I do not need you to tell me that.~
@7222 = ~I only give credit where it is due. At the moment I am not in need of anything, and even if I was, I would not bother with flattery. You should know me better than that, <CHARNAME>.~
@7223 = ~You are welcome. But do not get too used to praise; I only give credit where it is due.~
@7224 = ~Humility is one of the qualities essential in an excellent leader, you know. If you keep that in mind you just *might* become an excellent leader some day.~
@7225 = ~<CHARNAME>, considering your heritage, one might assume that you could actually have a chance for attaining divinity. Isn't that what your brother attempted? Do you think he could have succeeded? Could he actually have become a god?~
@7226 = ~No, I believe his 'ritual' was all wrong. There is no way he could have attained godhood by those means.~
@7227 = ~I don't know. I suppose it is possible that he could have succeeded. It was fortunate that I was there to stop him.~
@7228 = ~The worst thing he could have done was to start a war. And I must say that I'm relieved that he didn't succeed in doing it.~
@7229 = ~I think that he had something going for him, but it was not the right time nor the right place.~
@7230 = ~I don't see how digging into this is relevant by any means. Why don't you just leave it alone, Amber.~
@7231 = ~'By those means'? You think you have the right means then, <CHARNAME>?~
@7232 = ~Do you think we will see a time when someone needs to be there to stop you, <CHARNAME>?~
@7233 = ~I'm sure that you are not the only one, but do you think you are up for more than that?~
@7234 = ~Do you think the time and place will some day be right for you, <CHARNAME>?~
@7235 = ~What would you do with the legacy that Bhaal supposedly bequeathed to you and your 'siblings'?~
@7236 = ~I don't think I will be given much of a choice about that. There are greater forces at work regarding this whole Bhaalspawn issue.~
@7237 = ~Isn't it obvious? It is my destiny to become divine. And I will certainly be true to my father's spirit.~
@7238 = ~Isn't it obvious? It is my destiny to become divine. But I will be a force for good and justice, unlike my father.~
@7239 = ~If I was allowed to choose, I would rather be just me - without a preordained destiny or a share of divine blood.~
@7240 = ~I don't know if it's the road I am meant to take, and I definitely know it is not what Bhaal intended, but I will seek to make most of this somewhat unfortunate state of mine. You know, fortune, glory and all that.~
@7241 = ~I don't believe it is possible for a Bhaalspawn to aspire to godhood. Bhaal had a plan and I don't think it involved someone else taking his place.~
@7242 = ~You may feel like your life is orchestrated for you, but that's just because so many people seem to take exceptional interest in you. You simply have precious little time left for what *you* think or want.~
@7243 = ~I bet you will. And I could bet on a number of other things as well, but let's not go there just now.~
@7244 = ~Somehow I'm a bit leery of that word you used - 'justice'. There are just so many different conceptions of it; whose would you enforce?~
@7245 = ~There is not much that can be done about your blood, but perhaps you will some day find the peace you are looking for.~
@7246 = ~I suppose that's better than aspiring for the things Sarevok tried to achieve. But don't you think such a life would be rather... hollow?~
@7247 = ~Even the greatest of plans often have holes in them. Maybe even when - or especially when - one plays with pieces as large as the gods themselves.~
@7248 = ~No, I do not believe in 'destiny' or 'fate'. We make our own lives - that is the only thing that I hold on to in this life.~
@7249 = ~Fine I'll leave it alone, then...  For now.~
@7250 = ~I am not so sure that I agree. I, for one, obviously do have a destiny which is at least partly beyond my control. Or how else you would explain everything that has passed?~
@7251 = ~As you wish... In that case I should leave altogether. You know, for a moment I really thought that we had something special going on here - that we could have been friends. I guess that I was horribly wrong.~
@7252 = ~No, don't leave, Amber. I still value you as an ally even if we can't really make it as friends.~
@7253 = ~No, you got it all wrong... Did I say ever? For now, that is what I meant. I do not want to lose friendship forever, but I just need time to think.~
@7254 = ~Very well, I will stay for now. But I must warn you that since our relationship is now strictly a matter of business, I reserve the right to leave this party whenever I feel like it.~
@7255 = ~I should have guessed that you were a coward! If that's how much you appreciate friendship, I see no reason to stay in this party any longer.~
@7256 = ~Wouldn't you suppose that a friendly hug might mend the wounds, <CHARNAME>?~
@7257 = ~Well, I don't think it could do any harm. (Hug her.)~
@7258 = ~I am glad that we sorted this mess out, but I would really like to keep our friendship strictly, well, friendly.~
@7259 = ~(Amber hugs you back.) I'm glad that we got this sorted out.~
@7260 = ~A spoilsport, that's what you are, <CHARNAME>. (Despite your best efforts to resist Amber still manages to pat your shoulder in friendly manner.)~
@7261 = ~How does it feel, <CHARNAME>? Being in love?~
@7262 = ~Eh... What makes you think I'm in love with anyone?~
@7263 = ~I think you're mistaken, Amber. I'm not in love - I'm just having a bit of fun with Aerie, that's all.~
@7264 = ~I think you're mistaken, Amber. I'm not in love - I'm just having a bit of fun with Jaheira, that's all ~
@7265 = ~I think you're mistaken, Amber. I'm not in love - I'm just having a bit of fun with Viconia, that's all.~
@7266 = ~I think you're mistaken, Amber. I'm not in love - I'm just having a bit of fun with Anomen, that's all.~
@7267 = ~I think you're mistaken, Amber. I'm not in love - I'm just having a bit of fun with Kelsey, that's all.~
@7268 = ~I think you're mistaken, Amber. I'm not in love - I'm just having a bit of fun with Solaufein, that's all.~
@7269 = ~I think you're mistaken, Amber. I'm not in love - I'm just having a bit of fun with Chloe, that's all.~
@7270 = ~I think you're mistaken, Amber. I'm not in love - I'm just having a bit of fun with Kiara, that's all.~
@7271 = ~I think you're mistaken, Amber. I'm not in love - I'm just having a bit of fun with Valygar, that's all.~
@7272 = ~I think you're mistaken, Amber. I'm not in love - I'm just having a bit of fun with Tsujatha, that's all.~
@7273 = ~I think you're mistaken, Amber. I'm not in love - I'm just having a bit of fun with Fade, that's all.~
@7274 = ~I think you're mistaken, Amber. I'm not in love - I'm just having a bit of fun with Edwin, that's all.~
@7275 = ~I think you're mistaken, Amber. I'm not in love - I'm just having a bit of fun with Saerileth, that's all.~
@7276 = ~I really don't feel comfortable discussing intimate issues like that with you.~
@7277 = ~It's like something I've never felt before. I don't think that I have the words to describe it.~
@7278 = ~Being in love fills me with both joy and fear. I am both looking forward to and afraid of what the future might hold for us.~
@7279 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>. It is more than obvious that you're completely head over heels for Aerie. In a small group like ours, a thing like that doesn't stay a secret for long.~
@7280 = ~So, to get back to my question: how does it feel to be in love?~
@7281 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>. It is more than obvious that you're completely head over heels for Jaheira. In a small group like ours, a thing like that doesn't stay a secret for long.~
@7282 = ~I think you're mistaken, Amber. I'm not in love - I'm just having a bit of fun with Jaheira, that's all.~
@7283 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>. It is more than obvious that you're completely head over heels for Viconia. In a small group like ours, a thing like that doesn't stay a secret for long.~
@7284 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>. It is more than obvious that you're completely head over heels for Anomen. In a small group like ours, a thing like that doesn't stay a secret for long.~
@7285 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>. It is more than obvious that you're completely head over heels for Kelsey. In a small group like ours, a thing like that doesn't stay a secret for long.~
@7286 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>. It is more than obvious that you're completely head over heels for Solaufein. In a small group like ours, a thing like that doesn't stay a secret for long.~
@7287 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>. It is more than obvious that you're completely head over heels for Chloe. In a small group like ours, a thing like that doesn't stay a secret for long.~
@7288 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>. It is more than obvious that you're completely head over heels for Kiara. In a small group like ours, a thing like that doesn't stay a secret for long.~

@7290 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>. It is more than obvious that you're completely head over heels for Tsujatha. In a small group like ours, a thing like that doesn't stay a secret for long.~
@7291 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>. It is more than obvious that you're completely head over heels for Fade. In a small group like ours, a thing like that doesn't stay a secret for long.~
@7292 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>. It is more than obvious that you're completely head over heels for Edwin. In a small group like ours, a thing like that doesn't stay a secret for long.~
@7293 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>. It is more than obvious that you're completely head over heels for Saerileth. In a small group like ours, a thing like that doesn't stay a secret for long.~
@7294 = ~I see. (Amber frowns and then looks you straight in the eye.) I am not at all certain that Aerie is aware of you 'just having a bit of fun', as you so delicately put it. She is young and somewhat naive, and I don't think she is prepared to play games of the heart with you.~
@7295 = ~I see. (Amber frowns and does not speak for a moment.) I must admit that I'm surprised to hear that you two are just messing around. I would not have imagined that Jaheira would get herself mixed up in such games, but I suppose that I have misjudged her in that respect.~
@7296 = ~I see. (Amber frowns and does not speak for a moment.) I suppose that I can understand your desire to remain uncommitted with her. Viconia gives such mixed signals, does she not? But she is playing a dangerous game here - that much I know.~
@7297 = ~I see. (Amber frowns and does not speak for a moment.) Well, I would not count on Anomen understanding that. He seems to be taking the whole thing rather seriously and might get upset when he learns the truth. And I don't think I have to remind you that when Anomen gets emotional, he is not always in total control of himself.~
@7298 = ~I see. (Amber frowns and does not speak for a moment.) I'm sure that Kelsey is not courting a woman for the first time and I don't pretend to know how deeply he feels about you, but he is a very sweet guy and he seems to have grown very fond of you. I don't blame him though - you are a fascinating woman, <CHARNAME>. Try to treat him gently, all right?~
@7299 = ~I see. (Amber frowns and does not speak for a moment.) You are not at all worried about playing with the feelings of a drow? I would imagine that Solaufein would have wanted to leave such cruel games behind him when he left Underdark.~
@7300 = ~I see. (Amber frowns and does not speak for a moment.) You are either very brave or very foolish to risk the anger of a woman such as Chloe. I'm guessing the latter. I'm quite certain that she would not be pleased to find out that you are just toying with her.~
@7301 = ~I see. (Amber frowns and does not speak for a moment.) Well, I would not be surprised if your own game will turn against you. It seems to me that Kiara is someone who is more used to playing people for her own purposes than being played herself. She might not take kindly to you trying to use her.~
@7302 = ~I see. (Amber frowns and does not speak for a moment.)  There is something I cannot help wondering, though. You have put an awful lot of effort in gaining Valygar's trust; almost too much for just having a 'bit of fun', it would seem to me.~
@7303 = ~I see. (Amber frowns and does not speak for a moment.) Looks like you have found the weak spot that Tsujatha has for girls like you, <CHARNAME>, but I would think twice before messing around with a mage who is not hesitant about using his might to manipulate others.~
@7304 = ~I see. (Amber frowns and does not speak for a moment.) There are not many chances for a tiefling to find someone to trust in this rather unfriendly world. I should know that. I also know that that trust doesn't come cheap and is fragile at best. You should not misuse Fade's trust.~
@7305 = ~I see. (Amber frowns and does not speak for a moment.) At least we can safely assume that Edwin's affection for you can never measure up to his passion for his art. I'd still like to warn you; it's impossible to foretell how deeply his pride will be wounded when he catches up with your little game.~
@7306 = ~I see. (Amber frowns and then looks you straight in the eye.) Look, <CHARNAME>, Saerileth is just a kid. Enlightened as she might be, I really don't think she's up for your games. You should treat her feelings with more respect and make sure that she knows what's going on.~
@7307 = ~But the thing I am most surprised by is that you would find time to fool around during a time like this. I would understand, should you feel obligated to follow your heart, but to simply search for pleasure in a situation like this hardly seems appropriate.~
@7308 = ~I do what I want, Amber, and I don't really see it being any of your business.~
@7309 = ~To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure what is it that I feel. Perhaps I *am* in love or at least heading that way. I have little experience in this relationship business and I would not be surprised not to recognise love even if it stared me right in the eye.~
@7310 = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>. I shall not bother you any more.~
@7311 = ~Perhaps you don't need words for that, <CHARNAME>. Your feelings are mirrored in your eyes plainly enough, but I just hope you understand how lucky you are.~
@7312 = ~I think I understand what you mean, <CHARNAME>. If I was in your situation, I might not dare let myself become that close with anybody. However, I do admire you for the courage to do so.~
@7313 = ~It's not always easy to know your own heart, but I would like to encourage you to study it. And I would also like you to keep your sweetheart up to date. After all, how could either one of you make decisions about anything without knowing where you stand?~
@7314 = ~Well, I guess I did. I am sorry to have kept you from resting; next time I make a scene while sleeping, you just give me a kick, OK?~
@7315 = ~All right, <CHARNAME>. You must have a lot of thinking to do, then. At least if the amount of noise you were making in your sleep is of any indication.~
@7316 = ~That does it! I'm sick and tired of you walking around with your head up your ass and acting like a total prat. I'm not going to suffer your abuse for a minute longer. May you rot in hell where you belong.~
@7317 = ~*Hic.*~ [m#amb901]
@7318 = ~"Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me.
 We kindle and char, inflame and ignite,
 Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho.
 We burn up the city, we're really a fright,
 Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho."~ [m#amb902]
@7319 = ~*Hic.*~ [m#amb905]
@7320 = ~"We're rascals, scoundrels, villans, and knaves,
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho.
We're devils and black sheep, really bad eggs,
Drink up, me 'earties, yo ho.
Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me..."~ [m#amb903]
@7321 = ~Ahem... Yes... I think I'd better shut up now.~ [m#amb904]
@7322 = ~So this is what it's like. The place where my ancestry comes from, I mean. It's so... so bleak. So hopeless. At least I don't have enough of this place in my veins to make me feel at home in here. I would hate it if I did.~ [m#amb456]
@7323 = ~Come on, <CHARNAME>, let's go. I don't want to spend any more time here than I have to.~
@7324 = ~So, drow women turn you on after all? You wouldn't let me touch you looking like this, but you looked like you were more than willing to have a go at that she-spider.~ [m#amb245]
@7325 = ~Care to explain?~ [m#amb246]
@7326 = ~Don't be silly, Amber. I was only playing along to keep her from realising who we really are.~
@7327 = ~So, drow women turn you on, then? You looked like you were more than willing to have a go at that she-spider.~ [m#amb247]
@7328 = ~It better not. But since you find drow women so exciting, maybe I should take the chance to show you just how exciting I can be as a drow... Consider yourself warned.~
@7329 = ~It better not. I should have seen this coming, though, based on your reactions the other night. But be warned - the drow do not like to share their males. And I am no exception.~
@7330 = ~Carried away? Yet you wouldn't get 'carried away' with me, is that it? Maybe you should just go with that she-spider and let her carry you away.~
@7331 = ~And I am not? If you like her that much, why don't you just go and ask her to be your mistress? 'Cause you can be damn sure that I won't!~
@7332 = ~Well, you'd better.~
@7333 = ~Um, what was *that* about? You drooling over that she-spider, I mean.~
@7334 = ~I guess dark-skinned assertive women are just my thing.~
@7335 = ~Oh, that. I was only playing along to keep her from realising who we really are.~
@7336 = ~Well, I guess I just couldn't help myself. You'll have to admit that she *is* an intensely sensual woman. And it's not as if she wasn't interested.~
@7337 = ~Oh, I see. Are you planning to stay here among them, then?~
@7338 = ~I was only joking, Amber. You need not worry. I was only playing along to keep her from realising who we really are.~
@7339 = ~Hmmm... Now that would be a thought. But no, we have a quest to take care of first.~
@7340 = ~No, not really. Even if I could stay here, I don't think I would. Living underground would probably feel a bit confining. But that shouldn't stop me from enjoying my brief stay here, should it?~
@7341 = ~By the gods, no. But I sure wouldn't mind getting a bit more intimate with that drow priestess. It might make for an interesting experience.~
@7342 = ~Oh, I see. Although if you want my advice, I don't think drow males are expected to be quite that forward.~
@7343 = ~No, I don't think I do. And she seemed to respond just fine.~
@7344 = ~You are probably right. I guess my comment was a bit ill-judged. ~
@7345 = ~Oh, I see. Are you planning to stay here with her, then?~
@7346 = ~No, not really. Even if I could stay here, I don't think I would. Living underground would probably feel a bit confining. But shouldn't stop me from enjoying my brief stay here, does it?~
@7347 = ~By the gods, no. But I sure wouldn't mind getting a bit more intimate with her. It might make for an interesting experience.~
@7348 = ~Well, yes. And I guess you are also forgetting that you are not really a drow. I don't think she would take kindly to finding out your true nature.~
@7349 = ~Well, I guess it shouldn't. But I would like to remind you that despite your current appearance, you are not really a drow. I don't think she would take kindly to finding out your true nature.~
@7350 = ~I see. If that is how you feel, who am I to argue. But I would still like to point out that despite your current appearance, you are not really a drow. Although you sure do manage to behave like one. I guess you were not the person I thought wou were, after all.~
@7351 = ~I am glad you realise it as well. I guess this environment is getting to us all. I think you should be a bit more careful in the future.~
@7352 = ~<CHARNAME>, what in the Nine Hells was *that* about? You were practically drooling over that she-spider.~
@7353 = ~Well, I guess dark-skinned assertive women are just my thing.~
@7354 = ~I'm sorry, Amber. I don't know what got into me. I promise you it won't happen again.~
@7355 = ~Oh, and now you tell me. I guess you have just kept me around until you find the dark and exotic drow princess of your dreams. When exactly were you going to let me know of this newfound preference of yours?~
@7356 = ~Don't worry, Amber. I am sure that you realise it was only harmless flirtation. I am not really a drow, you know.~
@7357 = ~Well, I do find her rather intriguing. I am sure she would be rather interesting in bed.~
@7358 = ~Well, I guess you are probably right. Maybe I should stop trying so hard to pass for a drow.~
@7359 = ~Well, maybe I should. I am sure *she* would appreciate all of my manly abilities.~
@7360 = ~Well, maybe you should.~
@7361 = ~No, you are not, and I don't think she would take kindly to finding out your true nature. I am glad you realise that much. But I'm afraid that your antics are far from harmless.~
@7362 = ~Well, if that's what you think, maybe you should go and find out. I'm sure she would be more than willing to oblige you. Just don't expect me to stick around for that show.~
@7363 = ~Well, that's good to hear. I'd imagine it would spoil the mood somewhat.~
@7364 = ~I was only winding you up, Amber. You should know very well that I'm only interested in you. I hope you do realise that it was mere harmless flirtation. I am not really a drow, you know. ~
@7365 = ~Well, I sure do hope so.~
@7366 = ~Well, you need not worry about that. I'll find my own way out of this place.~
@7367 = ~Had a good time last night? I would have thought you had *some* standards, but I guess I was wrong. Just don't come complaining to me if you feel exhausted. I'm not interested.~
@7368 = ~Amber, I...~
@7369 = ~Yeah, I sure did.~
@7370 = ~Forget it. Let's get going~
@7371 = ~Well, maybe you should just stay here with her, then. I know I wouldn't miss you.~
@7372 = ~I see you managed to escape the she-spider unscathed. Not a mean feat at all - she seems like someone who is used to getting her way.~
@7373 = ~I see you managed to escape the she-spider unscathed. Not a mean feat at all - she seems like someone who is used to getting her way. It is good to see that my trust in you wasn't misplaced.~
@7374 = ~Wipe that innocent look off your face! I know very well what went on in there! How could you do it with that evil creature?~
@7375 = ~And don't you bat those big brown eyes at me. You won't be getting away with this one, <CHARNAME>.~
@7376 = ~Amber! Please, keep your voice down... You're endangering us all. I only did it to keep up our cover. Believe me when I say that I didn't enjoy it in the least.~
@7377 = ~Amber! Please, keep your voice down... You're endangering us all. I only did it to keep up our cover. Believe me when I say that I didn't enjoy it in the least. ~
@7378 = ~She would have killed us all if I hadn't done it: in a drow society males have to do as females say or face their wrath. It's not like I *wanted* her.~
@7379 = ~Oh, who cares if I had sex with Phaere? Shut your yap and get back in line.~
@7380 = ~And don't you bat those big yellow eyes at me. You won't be getting away with this one, <CHARNAME>.~
@7381 = ~And don't you bat those big green eyes at me. You won't be getting away with this one, <CHARNAME>.~
@7382 = ~And don't you bat those big blue eyes at me. You won't be getting away with this one, <CHARNAME>.~
@7383 = ~And don't you bat those big grey eyes at me. You won't be getting away with this one, <CHARNAME>.~
@7384 = ~And don't you bat those big violet eyes at me. You won't be getting away with this one, <CHARNAME>.~
@7385 = ~And don't you bat those big black eyes at me. You won't be getting away with this one, <CHARNAME>.~
@7386 = ~And don't you bat those big eyes at me. You won't be getting away with this one, <CHARNAME>.~
@7387 = ~Well, you sure wanted her enough to get it up, didn't you? Very well, I will pretend that you were thinking of me; after all, she didn't give you much choice. These drow are quite good at getting what they want. Just be careful that you don't begin to resemble them too much.~
@7388 = ~Well, you sure wanted her enough to get it up, didn't you? I believe none of your excuses! Your nights will be lonely from now on. You can be sure that *I* won't be there to keep you warm anymore.~
@7389 = ~You dog! I will have no more of this - I hope you rot in this place!~
@7390 = ~<CHARNAME>, are you sure about this path that you have chosen for us?~
@7391 = ~I assure you that this is only a temporary situation. Sometimes the measures you have to take in order to achieve some greater good can seem rather drastic.~
@7392 = ~Oh come on, Amber. Don't be such a spoilsport. You should not take life so seriously.~
@7393 = ~I'm not really interested in what you think, redhead, so why don't you just go and nag at someone else.~
@7394 = ~I'm not sure if you're still the same man I met and learned to care for. Why are you doing such things?~ [m#amb478]
@7395 = ~You're right, of course, but I still cannot help feeling that we may be going about this the wrong way.~
@7396 = ~No need to mock me, <CHARNAME>. I have every right to question your behaviour, especially since you do not see the need to do it yourself.~
@7397 = ~Oh? So now I'm nagging? Well, maybe I should reconsider my presence in your company, <CHARNAME>.~
@7398 = ~I demand to know what this foolishness is all about! I will not stick around for this much longer!~ [m#amb479]
@7399 = ~Hush, Amber, everything will be just fine. Just have little more faith in me, that's all I ask.~
@7400 = ~Amber, aren't you taking this a wee bit too seriously? I always thought you didn't care what other people thought of you.~
@7401 = ~You demand? The last time I checked, I was the leader of this group. I will do whatever I wish, and if you have a problem with it, you can get lost.~
@7402 = ~I'll try, but things *will* have to change.~
@7403 = ~I don't care what other people think, but I do care what I think of myself. I cannot allow myself to be a part of these evil deeds for much longer.~
@7404 = ~It is you who is already lost, <CHARNAME>. And quite frankly, I'm tired of looking after you. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~
@7405 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>... I don't recognise you at all anymore. What is happening to you?~ [m#amb480]
@7406 = ~What are you talking about?  I could care less for you spitting in ugly language of yours.~ [m#amb485]
@7407 = ~Don't pretend to know what I want. And besides, you should stop treating people like property. Now move out of my way, drow.~
@7408 = ~Get your ass out of my way or I will make you regret opening your mouth in the first place. And let go of my arm!~
@7409 = ~Viconia, leave Amber alone! She's right - I am not your property and I never will be.~
@7410 = ~Amber, stop threatening Viconia. She has every right to question you. Besides, your staring makes me uncomfortable, too.~
@7411 = ~Girls, girls... Please don't fight - I'm man enough for both of you.~
@7412 = ~I threaten whom I see fit, <CHARNAME>. And if my presence is making you so uncomfortable, why don't you just tell me to leave.~
@7413 = ~Stop giving yourself airs, <CHARNAME>. You're only making a fool of yourself. ~
@7414 = ~Jaheira, I don't appreciate people telling me what to do. Especially if their motives are questionable.~ [m#amb486]
@7415 = ~Oh, don't give me that look, druid. I know the game you're playing. Don't you think it's rather hypocritical of you to caution me about the age difference between myself and <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb487]
@7416 = ~I do not wish any quarrel between us, Jaheira. Sort out your feelings about <CHARNAME> and be honest about them. I will do the same and we'll see what happens.~
@7417 = ~I don't pretend to be an expert on matters of the heart, but even I can tell that Aerie is having a bit of a crush on you, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb489]
@7418 = ~Whatever your feelings for her are, I'd suggest you be quite frank about them. Aerie is obviously not very experienced in the game of love and her imagination might play tricks on her.~
@7419 = ~You mean that she might not realise that I see her as nothing more than a friend?~
@7420 = ~You mean that she might not realise that I have feelings for her?~
@7421 = ~Don't try to play a matchmaker here, Amber. I can take care of my own business, thank you very much.~
@7422 = ~Perhaps... Although, even if you had feelings for her, I don't think she would necessarily realise it, seeing how insecure she is. ~
@7423 = ~Umm... Well, you might want to make them more obvious, so that *she* can be sure of it as well.~
@7424 = ~Whatever you say. But matters of the heart are a serious business; you should not play around with the feelings of others.~
@7425 = ~I think I have already bothered you enough about this, and it's not as if it was any of my business anyway. We should get going.~
@7426 = ~<CHARNAME>, I would like to ask you about something.~ [m#amb490]
@7427 = ~Yes, sure. Go ahead, Amber.~
@7428 = ~No, not now. Whatever it is, it has to wait.~
@7429 = ~No, I'm afraid it can't wait.~ [m#amb491]
@7430 = ~I noticed you holding hands with Solaufein and I just wanted to know whether there was more to it than mere friendship?~ [m#amb492]
@7431 = ~No, Amber, we were just friends having a conversation and there is nothing more to it.~
@7432 = ~Of course we're just friends! He was merely making a point on destiny. I thought that was one of your favourite subjects, too.~
@7433 = ~I'm sort of glad that you brought it up, Amber. I - I think that I have feelings for Solaufein, and I don't think that I can be with you anymore.~
@7434 = ~I'm glad to hear that, love. Having a close friend never hurt anyone.~
@7435 = ~Hey, no need to get so agitated. I did not mean to accuse you or anything! Of course you can hold hands with the drow if you wish to.~
@7436 = ~You're leaving me! Just like that?~ [m#amb493]
@7437 = ~I guess I should be glad that you told me now instead of later. So be it. If you think that you can be happy with the drow, I won't stand between you two.~ [m#amb494]
@7438 = ~Is there something you should tell me, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb495]
@7439 = ~Uh... If you're speaking of Solaufein, we're just friends.~
@7440 = ~No, should there be something?~
@7441 = ~Amber, dear...~
@7442 = ~Come on! Dancing with Solaufein? Do you take me as a complete fool?~ [m#amb496]
@7443 = ~Amber, I've told you before and I tell you again: we are just friends, Solaufein and myself, and...~
@7444 = ~Oh, the dance? He was just showing me the steps. So that I could dance it with you.~
@7445 = ~...there is nothing more to it. Fine, I believe you for now.~
@7446 = ~Well, *I* don't know how to dance nor do I care to learn, so you can stop taking lessons. Besides...~
@7447 = ~You might think that you're just friends with the drow, but haven't you seen the looks he gives you? There is no trace of friendship there - he hungers after you, <CHARNAME>. You should end it before his lust for you grows too hot.~ [m#amb497]
@7448 = ~I... I guess I should be glad that you told me now instead of later. So be it. If you think that you can be happy with the drow, I won't stand between you two.~ [m#amb494]
@7449 = ~This is going too far, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb498]
@7450 = ~It is obvious that your interest lies on something - or more specifically on someone - else. Funny, somehow I thought that you would have the backbone to tell me before, but obviously I have mistaken you for someone you are not.~ [m#amb499]
@7451 = ~Amber, what are you talking about? There is nobody else for me.~
@7452 = ~Amber, you are right - my feelings for Solaufein are strong indeed. I am sorry if I have led you to believe something else.~
@7453 = ~Don't lie to me, <CHARNAME>. Your feelings for Solaufein are more than obvious.~ [m#amb500]
@7454 = ~Amber, I swear to you. There is nothing romantic going on between Solaufein and myself. Certainly you must believe me?~
@7455 = ~You could be a bit more supportive, Amber. I *do* have needs that you will never be able to satisfy.~
@7456 = ~I don't know how you do it, but I believe you. Though my heart warns against it, I want to believe you.~
@7457 = ~I can't believe you! You keep spinning your lies like a spider spins his web, even when it's obvious no-one believes them anymore. I've had enough of them!~ [m#amb501]
@7458 = ~You are so full of crap that you hardly need any support. I'm sick of your lies, <CHARNAME>.~
@7459 = ~(Amber meets your eyes with a gaze filled with such anger that you think it is going to make you blind - or worse - for the rest of your sorry life.)~
@7460 = ~(Look away.)~
@7461 = ~(Stand your ground.)~
@7462 = ~Don't you tear your eyes away from mine! Look at me, <CHARNAME>!~ [m#amb502]
@7463 = ~Why have you been lying to me about your feelings for the drow? Why did you have to humiliate me by sleeping with him? *Everyone* could hear your moans!~ [m#amb503]
@7464 = ~You could have just told me that you did not care for me anymore, if you ever really did! Or... or I could even have agreed to take Solaufein into our bed, had you really wanted it. If it would have made you happy... I-I don't know if I would have enjoyed it - I love you and hunger for no-one else to touch me, but maybe the drow would not have been interested in touching me anyway...~ [m#amb504]
@7465 = ~Now that sounds interesting...~
@7466 = ~Amber, I'm sorry. I should have told you. I was just so confused with my feelings, but it's all clear to me now. I'm afraid it's over between you and me.~
@7467 = ~NO! This was a mistake! I don't want to be with Solaufein! I want you Amber, only you!~
@7468 = ~I hate you! You're a lying piece of scum, nothing more! I'm sorry that we ever met!~ [m#amb505]
@7469 = ~(Without seeing her, you can sense Amber's presence. A strange feeling comes over you - a mix of uneasiness and anticipation.)~
@7470 = ~(Ever since she joined the party, the tiefling seems to have been strangely drawn to you. You have often caught Amber studying you intensively, as if she was trying to puzzle you out.)~
@7471 = ~(The tiefling's interest in your person is hardly a secret anymore, but she's still quite modest in displaying her affections.)~
@7472 = ~(With your relationship with Amber growing deeper, she seems to be more and more at ease in your company.)~
@7473 = ~(You catch Amber studying your profile. When Amber realises that she has been caught, she makes an effort to pretend that she was looking at something extremely interesting behind you.)~
@7474 = ~Are you thirsty <CHARNAME>? Your waterskin looks empty. Here, have a sip from mine.~ [m#amb400]
@7475 = ~I'm not really thirsty, but thanks anyway.~
@7476 = ~(Take the waterskin Amber is offering you.)~
@7477 = ~Oh? Never mind, then.~ [m#amb401]
@7478 = ~(As you grab the waterskin, your hand briefly touches Amber's. You can feel her hand twitch under your touch. Strangely enough, Amber seems to be extremely annoyed by this and turns quickly away, blushing and leaving you standing baffled, her waterskin in your hand.)~
@7479 = ~<CHARNAME>? I was... Oh, never mind, just forget that I said anything.~ [m#amb402]
@7480 = ~(Say nothing.)~
@7481 = ~Amber, if you wanted to say something, please say it.~
@7482 = ~I said forget it!~ [m#amb403]
@7483 = ~(You catch Amber studying your profile. When your eyes meet, her lips part slightly as if she is about to say something, but apparently she decides not to and quickly turns away.)~
@7484 = ~(You catch Amber studying your profile. A slight hint of rosy colour rises to her cheeks when your eyes meet.)~
@7485 = ~Um... Hey, <CHARNAME>, is that dirt on your cheek? You don't suppose you should wash your face every now and then?~ [m#amb404]
@7486 = ~<CHARNAME>?~
@7487 = ~Hmmm... Never mind, actually. I'm beginning to feel like I'm bothering you way too often.~ [m#amb405]
@7488 = ~(You catch Amber studying your profile. Instead of blushing and turning her eyes away before you can meet them, she looks you directly in the eyes and smiles warmly at you.)~
@7489 = ~(You catch Amber studying your profile. She blushes slightly, but instead of turning away, she reaches out to gently brush your cheek with her fingertips.)~
@7490 = ~There was a speck of dust there, but it's gone now.~ [m#amb406]
@7491 = ~You had a runaway lock of hair there, but now it's all sorted out again.~ [m#amb407]
@7492 = ~(You can't help noticing that Amber and Imoen have spent quite a long while with their heads together, whispering and giggling like little girls. The occasional glance at your direction leaves no question about the topic of their discussion.)~
@7493 = ~(When they realise that you have noticed them, they turn away from you, blushing and laughing hysterically, which is more than enough to make your ears burn.)~
@7494 = ~(As you open your journal to write down some notes, you notice a small flower tucked between the first pages. How it got there, you have no idea.)~
@7495 = ~(Amber takes your hand, but instead of simply holding it, she turns it around and studies your palm intently.)~
@7496 = ~I bet you are one of those people for whom fortune-tellers always predict horrible things.~ [m#amb408]
@7497 = ~When I was travelling with the circus, the young girls there played a game of fortune-telling in which they always predicted rich husbands, true love and other sweet things to each other.~ [m#amb172]

@7499 = ~I wonder... what should I predict for you now that Madame Sonia is not here to disapprove?~ [m#amb409]
@7500 = ~You could predict that you will hold my hand more often in the future.~
@7501 = ~I could really use a rich spouse, too.~
@7502 = ~Still being alive tomorrow would be a good start.~
@7503 = ~Isn't true love something anyone would wish for themselves?~
@7504 = ~I'm not interested in fortune-telling games.~
@7505 = ~You should not make fun of such things, Amber.~
@7506 = ~Hmmm.. Let me see...~ [m#amb410]
@7507 = ~My mystic powers tell me that it is not entirely unlikely that it will occur again in your near future.~ [m#amb411]
@7508 = ~I never realised you had so much in common with young maidens, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb412]
@7509 = ~All right, then. I can clearly see that you will one day marry a disgustingly rich noble with an estate that will make everyone green with envy. You will live a long, healthy life and take growing roses as your principal pastime.~ [m#amb413]
@7510 = ~Good enough?~ [m#amb414]
@7511 = ~You really do settle for the little things in life, don't you? Well, I suppose that in the end, that's all you really need. Anything more is just a welcome bonus.~ [m#amb415]
@7512 = ~Well, you sure don't settle for little. Should you get it, I don't think you would really have much else to hope for.~ [m#amb416]
@7513 = ~Apparently I not a much of a seer, then. I really didn't foresee that you would be such a bore, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb417]
@7514 = ~I almost can't believe how much I enjoy your company, <CHARNAME>. I hope it doesn't bother you.~ [m#amb418]
@7515 = ~(Amber takes your hand between her hands and smiles at you.)~
@7516 = ~You just might be the best thing that ever happened to me... I'm just glad that we met.~ [m#amb419]
@7517 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb420]
@7518 = ~For what, Amber?~
@7519 = ~For everything...~ [m#amb421]
@7520 = ~It's funny how comforting it can feel, just holding your hand.~ [m#amb422]
@7521 = ~(Completely without warning, Amber comes up to you, wraps her slender arms around you and pulls you close.)~
@7522 = ~You looked like you needed a good, old-fashioned hug, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb423]
@7523 = ~Everything is going to work out just fine. Trust me, as bleak as it might seem, I have a good feeling about this quest of ours.~ [m#amb424]
@7524 = ~Just hold me for a while, will you?~ [m#amb425]
@7525 = ~You smell nice for a change, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb426]
@7526 = ~(Almost absent-mindedly Amber reaches out to stroke your full beard. Being as sensitive about people fiddling with your precious beard as any dwarf, you almost push her away, but instead decide that it does not feel that bad after all. Actually, you find yourself quite enjoying it.)~
@7527 = ~Is it true what they say about elves and their ears?~ [m#amb427]
@7528 = ~Eh? I don't know. What do they say about elves and their ears? ~
@7529 = ~Why don't you come and find out yourself, Amber?~
@7530 = ~Certainly not! There is absolutely no truth to whatever you might have heard about our ears.~
@7531 = ~Err... Never mind what I said, okay? It was just a rumour anyway.~ [m#amb428]
@7532 = ~Hah! Don't say things you might come to regret later on. (Amber winks at you.)~ [m#amb429]
@7533 = ~That's what you say, but you burning ears tell me something else, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb430]
@7534 = ~(Amber makes a surprise attack towards your feet! She wraps her right arm tightly around your knees - pulling you to the ground in the process - and shamelessly takes advantage of your habit of not wearing any shoes: she tickles your feet until you pray for the sweet release of death to end the excruciating agony of being tickled to death.)~
@7535 = ~(Finally she releases you, still giggling.) Uh, I'm so sorry about that, <CHARNAME>. I honestly don't know what possessed me to do that. (Amber throws a mischievous smile at you.)~ [m#amb431]
@7536 = ~You humans seem to be the most widespread race on Faerûn. I wonder why...~ [m#amb432]
@7537 = ~I honestly don't know the answer to that, Amber.~
@7538 = ~Well, I just might know a possible answer to that, but I really can't demonstrate it to you now. Not while others are around.~
@7539 = ~I really don't think we have yet beaten the kobolds in numbers, Amber.~
@7540 = ~You don't? Well that's a pity, isn't it?~ [m#amb433]
@7541 = ~All talk, no action, eh?~ [m#amb434]
@7542 = ~I think you're right, <CHARNAME>. And even if you managed to beat the kobolds, there'd always be the rabbits. I'd think trying to outnumber them would prove... interesting..~ [m#amb435]
@7543 = ~(Amber locks her eyes with yours. You can see yourself reflected in her eyes.)~
@7544 = ~You know, it may be my heart doing the talking, but I don't think I have ever met anyone with eyes as lovely and brown as yours are, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had time to lose myself in them for a while longer...~ [m#amb436]
@7545 = ~You know, it might be my heart doing the talking, but I don't think I have ever met anyone whose eyes were of as bright a yellow as yours are, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had time to lose myself in them for a while longer...~ [m#amb437]
@7546 = ~You know, it might be my heart doing the talking, but I don't think I have ever met anyone whose eyes could match the luminous green of yours, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had time to lose myself in them for a while longer...~
@7547 = ~You know, it might be my heart doing the talking, but I don't think I have ever met anyone whose eyes could match the brilliant blue of yours, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had time to lose myself in them for a while longer...~ [m#amb438]
@7548 = ~You know, it might be my heart doing the talking, but I don't think I have ever met anyone with eyes of such a soothing grey colour as yours are, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had time to lose myself in them for a while longer...~ [m#amb439]
@7549 = ~You know, it might be my heart doing the talking, but I don't think I have ever met anyone with eyes of as fascinating a hue of violet as yours are, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had time to lose myself in them for a while longer...~ [m#amb440]
@7550 = ~You know, it might be my heart doing the talking, but I don't think I have ever met anyone with eyes quite as black as yours, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had time to lose myself in them for a while longer...~ [m#amb441]
@7551 = ~You know, it might be my heart doing the talking, but I don't think I have ever met anyone with eyes of as exotic a hue as yours are, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had time to lose myself in them for a while longer...~ [m#amb442]

@7553 = ~(Amber reaches out to run her slender fingers through you hair.)~
@7554 = ~(For a while, she playfully twirls a lock of your hair with her fingers before leaving your mane alone.)~
@7555 = ~(She buries her fingers into your short, thick hair and rubs your scalp affectionately. The knowledge that your hair is left quite messed up does nothing to make the experience less pleasurable.)~
@7556 = ~<CHARNAME>, I found this hair on my sleeve. I think it's yours and I was wondering whether you would mind if I kept it? I hope you don't find it odd that I should want to keep it.~ [m#amb444]
@7557 = ~No, I don't find it odd at all, if it indeed is my hair you have found. In fact, I have been keeping a strand of your hair safe between the pages of my journal.~
@7558 = ~I'd prefer if you wouldn't keep it.~
@7559 = ~How do you know it's mine anyway? For all I know, it could be anyone's.~
@7560 = ~In some odd way, that is kind of cute, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb445]
@7561 = ~Whatever floats your boat, <CHARNAME>. Although I really don't see the harm in it.~ [m#amb446]
@7562 = ~I'd like to think that I have learned to recognise a hair of yours by now. Besides, no-one else in our party has hair of quite the same sandy brown colour as yours, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb447]

@7571 = ~I'd like to think that I have learned to recognise a hair of yours by now. Besides, no-one else in our party has hair of such a vibrant hue of red as yours, <CHARNAME>. It's definitely not one of mine.~ [m#amb447]
@7572 = ~I'd like to think that I have learned to recognise a hair of yours by now. Besides, no-one else in our party has hair of quite the same colour as yours, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb447]
@7573 = ~(Amber walks past you - quite a bit closer to you than she would have had to, and you could swear that she slows her pace a little just as she passes by you. You can feel her hip press against your thigh and her breast brush past your arm.)~
@7574 = ~(You fight the urge to grab her and pull her against you. While staring at her back, you can practically see her lips curve into a wicked smile.)~
@7575 = ~(Making a surprise attack from behind, Amber literally jumps on you: she wraps her slender legs tightly around your waist and her arms around your neck and shoulders.)~
@7576 = ~(Sadly, she does not seem interested in a piggyback ride - after planting a wet kiss just below your ear, she hops off you, giggling mischievously.)~
@7577 = ~<CHARNAME>..? (Amber approaches you and runs her hand down your chest.) Why don't we camp early today. ~ [m#amb448]
@7578 = ~(She leans in and whispers into your ear, her breath hot on your neck.) I want to feel you... I want you, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb449]
@7579 = ~I wonder if all the children of Bhaal are as gorgeous as you, my love? Not that I'd really care to know - you're more than enough for me.~ [m#amb450]
@7580 = ~(Amber takes your hand and entwines her long fingers between yours. You walk in silence for a moment, just enjoying the company of each other.)~
@7581 = ~I don't think that I have ever cared about anyone like I care about you, <CHARNAME>. You do know that, don't you?~ [m#amb451]
@7582 = ~We should do this more often. Walking hand in hand, you know. It feels kind of nice.~ [m#amb453]
@7583 = ~(Suddenly she stops and wraps her arms around your waist, pulling you close.)~
@7584 = ~You just looked like you could use a hug, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb452]
@7585 = ~(After a good while Amber lets your hand go. She does not leave your side, however.)~
@7586 = ~(After a good while Amber lets your hand go. Before leaving your side, she lovingly runs her hand along your arm.)~

@7588 = ~Don't you think that it's curious how such small gestures can bring so much comfort? At least I feel all warm inside every time you so much as look at me, not to mention the times you touch me...~ [m#amb455]

@7590 = ~(Leave Amber alone.)~
@7591 = ~(Amber is still upset with you. You would be wise not to disturb her.)~
@7592 = ~Amber, I feel that we need to talk. I don't want to go on like this.~
@7593 = ~Leave amber alone.~

@7595 = ~(Your thoughts - soon followed by your eyes - once again turn to Amber, distracting you from the task at hand. The grace with which she carries herself beside you never ceases to captivate your senses.)~
@7596 = ~(Amber, your faithful companion in arms, is walking softly by your side, her alert eyes constantly observing her surroundings.)~
@7597 = ~(Amber, the enigmatic tiefling, is walking softly by your side, her alert eyes constantly observing her surroundings.)~
@7598 = ~So, the matron mother gave us three choices. What do you think we should do?~
@7599 = ~Amber, I would like you to tell me more about yourself.~
@7600 = ~(Flirt with Amber.)~
@7601 = ~Amber, there is something I want to say to you.~
@7602 = ~(As you approach Amber, she turns away from you and you get the feeling that she does not want to talk to you.)~
@7603 = ~What is your take on this? Would you rather trust the Shadow Thieves to help us or throw your lot in with this mysterious Valen's 'mistress'?~
@7604 = ~Do you think that I made the right decision in trusting our lives to Saemon once again?~
@7605 = ~Do you think that I made the right decision in choosing to brave the long tunnels of the Underdark?~
@7606 = ~What's your opinion on this? Should we hand the mantle over to the Lurraxols or the Alibakkars? Or do you think we should heed Lord Logan's advice?~
@7607 = ~Could we talk for a moment, Amber? About my soul?~
@7608 = ~Amber, I would like to sort out what happened earlier between you and me.~
@7609 = ~How are you doing, Amber?~
@7610 = ~All right, what do you want to know?~
@7611 = ~Umm... Never mind, I can't think of anything to ask after all.~
@7612 = ~So, how did you end up in the Athkatlan prison in the first place?~
@7613 = ~Could you tell me more about tieflings? ~
@7614 = ~You say that I should not judge anybody based on first impressions, yet that is exactly what you seem to do all the time. Care to explain?~
@7615 = ~Could you tell me more about those tattoos you have?~
@7616 = ~You mentioned the Dock Ward of Waterdeep. Is that where you grew up?~
@7617 = ~Would you not tell me more about your friend Jill?~
@7618 = ~Can you tell me more of the circus you were travelling with?~
@7619 = ~I would like to ask you a few questions about your trapeze partner, Sasha.~
@7620 = ~You're not playing any games with Haer'Dalis behind my back, are you?~
@7621 = ~I see that you are getting along with Haer'Dalis nowadays.~
@7622 = ~I was just wondering... it was you who poisoned that guard back there, wasn't it?~
@7623 = ~Um... To be perfectly honest, I really wanted to talk about Aerie.~
@7624 = ~Um... To be perfectly honest, I really wanted to talk about Anomen.~
@7625 = ~What do you want to know? I'm not sure this is necessarily the best time, however...~

@7646 = ~How would you like a game of riddles, Amber?~
@7647 = ~Everything is going to be fine, Amber. I'm right here to protect you.~
@7648 = ~Well, spit it out then.~
@7649 = ~Actually I have changed my mind, maybe we can talk later.~
@7650 = ~Amber, I think you're a valuable companion.~
@7651 = ~I just want you to know that I am glad to have you with me. That lich you just slew was a real mean bastard and could easily have blown you to high heaven. You were very brave back there, Amber.~
@7652 = ~I just wanted to congratulate you for finishing that giant eye tyrant. Now I know that taking you in was the right decision.~
@7653 = ~As much as I would have wanted to finish Bodhi myself, I'll have to thank you for what you did. She was not an easy opponent and had you not taken her down right then and there, she might have slipped away once more. I'm glad that I had the sense to take you with me.~
@7654 = ~I just wanted to tell you that I'm glad that I took you with me. That Shade Lord was one unpleasant character, and I don't think I'm the only one who appreciates you getting rid of him. Thank you, Amber.~
@7655 = ~I just wanted to congratulate the latest dragonslayer in the party, Amber. That was a job well done.~
@7656 = ~Just wanted say how impressed I am with the way you took down that giant troll. TorGal was probably the meanest troll I've ever seen, and I have to say that I've seen more than my fair share of them.~
@7657 = ~I just wanted to say how glad I am that I took you with me. That Warden certainly put on the heat back there. Good work with putting that final nail on his coffin, Amber.~
@7658 = ~Well, spit it out then. But make it quick - this is hardly the time for idle chit-chat.~
@7659 = ~Amber, I think you have been very brave. I have to admit that this place gives me the creeps as well.~
@7660 = ~Amber, I think you have been very brave. I can understand why this place scares you.~
@7661 = ~Speak and I will listen. For now.~
@7662 = ~I would like to have a word with you about that incident about you touching me earlier.~
@7663 = ~I would like to have a word with you about what you said to me earlier.~
@7664 = ~Um, Amber, could you spare a moment? I believe that I might have been a little rude to you on the other night and I have something I would like to say to you.~
@7665 = ~Amber, I think that I am ready now. To, you know... Would you grant me the honour?~
@7666 = ~Very well, what do you propose?~
@7667 = ~No, now is not a good time. It is too dangerous here - we should stay on our or guard at all times.~
@7668 = ~Well, both seem pretty much equally bad options to me. This Valen character seems downright creepy, not to mention those creatures that have been attacking the Shadow Thieves lately. There is definitely something amiss there.~
@7669 = ~But on the other hand, trusting our fate to the thieves' guild... is not something I would do lightly. From what I have learned, these guilds stop at nothing if they think you have somehow wronged them or owe them something. Even your money is no guarantee. Loyalty bought with gold only lasts up to the point someone makes them a better offer.~
@7670 = ~For all we know, these thieves might already be working for your enemy. Of course, if you pay them enough they just might be favourable to you for the time being. I am sorry but I don't think I can be of much help in this matter, apart from trying  to save you from the disaster that undoubtedly follows from choosing to side with either of these potential 'allies'.~
@7671 = ~If you ask me, I'd say that we get our own ship and make it for the mainland without Saemon. But since the waters seem to be especially treacherous around this island, we might need a captain after all.~
@7672 = ~Since we cannot afford to stay on this island a minute longer, I think that we were pretty much forced to take Saemon up on his offer. But we should watch him very closely and bring our own food this time around. One of us should always keep watch even though he cannot really betray us any worse that he already has.~
@7673 = ~The Underdark... You do not want to go there. Not unless there is no other way and even then you should consider just staying where you are right now. And who knows where that portal really leads; we could end up in the Nine Hells for all we know.~
@7674 = ~But since you already turned down Saemon's most likely treacherous offer to get us out of this sealed fortress, and we cannot afford to stay on this island a minute longer, we are pretty much forced to take the risk.~
@7675 = ~You know what I think of meddling in the affairs of nobles: trouble is the only thing they will reward us with, regardless of what we do. Give the mantle to the High Merchant and be rid of it for once and for all. ~
@7676 = ~But there's good money to be had from those noble families. Gold is gold to the noble and the commoner alike, you know.~
@7677 = ~But there's good money to be had from those noble families. We need it to rescue Imoen.~
@7678 = ~But there's good money to be had from those noble families. We need it to get to Irenicus.~
@7679 = ~I guess you have a point there. It's the right thing to do anyway.~
@7680 = ~Giving the mantle to the High Merchant would be the easy way out, yes. However, I think this city would be better off without two powerful families constantly fighting each other for control. Giving the mantle to one of them would help lay things to rest.~
@7681 = ~Gold isn't everything. We already have enough to get by.~
@7682 = ~You are right, of course, but I'd say you are lucky if you get even half of what they've promised you.~
@7683 = ~And that goes not only for those so called nobles but equally for the Shadow Thieves.~
@7684 = ~Well, supposing that the mayor won't sell it for his own profit, it is. And he does seem like a decent fellow, after all.~
@7685 = ~Excepting the fact that they both seem so rotten to the core that it could hardly be beneficial for anyone for one of them to gain control of the city.~
@7686 = ~Well, it seems that we've once again got our backs up against the wall. I don't really like any of the options she gave us, but I guess we'll just have to pick the least of three evils.~
@7687 = ~I believe that the kuo-toa are the least dangerous of the three, but I guess they also pose the least of a threat if left alone. Beholders and mind flayers are both vicious monsters and are much more likely to come after us regardless of whether we go looking for them than the kuo-toa.~
@7688 = ~If we have to choose between the beholders and the mind flayers, I would say that going for the beholders seems more attractive. First of all, there seems to be an ongoing power struggle between the local drow and illithid societies. We certainly wouldn't want to eliminate the principal enemy of the drow and allow them to pursue other targets.~
@7689 = ~Second, if I'm going to die doing this, I'd rather be stared to death by a giant eyeball than have my brains sucked out of my skull. I could really appreciate the irony of being killed by a single look after a lifetime of being stared at.~
@7690 = ~But I guess it is up to *you* to decide whether we have the strength to face the beholders or whether we should take the easier way out and go looking for the kuo-toa prince.~
@7691 = ~Certainly. I did say that I would be willing to listen if you wanted to talk about it, did I not?~
@7692 = ~I-I don't know if I can take this any more. I feel so empty and drained. How long do you think one can go on without a soul?~
@7693 = ~I-I just don't know how much longer I can watch Imoen suffer. I can bear my own pain, but it is just too much for me to see her wither away when I can do nothing to help her.~
@7694 = ~Um, I think I've changed my mind. I feel just fine. ~
@7695 = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>.~
@7696 = ~Now that is one question I don't have a ready answer to. I suppose that you will just keep going on as long as you need to, <CHARNAME>. You are one of the strongest persons that I have ever met, and I am not referring to your physical strength here.~
@7697 = ~But I never wanted any part in all this. If only I could be just an ordinary person.~
@7698 = ~But it's just so wrong! *sob* I never asked for any of this.~
@7699 = ~But it's not fair! I am supposed to be on my way to claim my father's legacy! Irenicus and Bodhi are interfering with my destiny and it's driving me crazy.~
@7700 = ~But what if we cannot find Bodhi in time? What if it is already too late?~
@7701 = ~Perhaps you are right. Maybe it would be best to move on instead of wasting time in idle banter.~
@7702 = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>. I just cannot see why you came to talk to me in the first place if you believed this to be a waste of time all along.~
@7703 = ~Isn't that something we all wish? (Amber smiles wistfully.) But seriously, I think you are coping with your situation better than many would.~
@7704 = ~It's definitely not fair, but you have to remember that you have gained as well. Few people could even dream about all the things you have seen.~
@7705 = ~This is no time to despair, <CHARNAME>. You surely *could* just lie down and die, but I seriously doubt that you will.~
@7706 = ~Well, what would you expect? Frankly, I find it hard to imagine them doing anything else. After all, you have something they desperately need and Irenicus seems to be well beyond such concepts as 'fair', as you must have noticed already. If he can find a way to take something he needs, he will. There are no rules in the game he is playing.~
@7707 = ~You don't understand me! No one ever has! It is my destiny! ~
@7708 = ~But what will I do without my soul? I feel like I'm not even a person anymore.~
@7709 = ~Why am I wasting my time talking to you? We should not linger here for a second longer, let's move on.~
@7710 = ~You know what, <CHARNAME>? You are right, I don't understand you. I don't understand why you are chasing the legacy of a dead god of murder. I cannot understand how that legacy could carry with it anything but ill. Now, if we want to have even the slightest chance of catching up with Bodhi, we should get going. I can only hope that retrieving your soul will knock you back to your senses.~
@7711 = ~Then we should make haste to get it back, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps all this will turn out for the better - now that you know what you are losing, you won't be so keen to throw it away in your mindless desire for godhood.~
@7712 = ~I know how you feel and I'm worried about her too, but she is strong. We still have time to find Bodhi.~
@7713 = ~But it's just so wrong! *sob* She has never hurt anyone. I would gladly have taken her burden as well, would that have been possible.~
@7714 = ~How can you know that? For all we know, she could collapse any moment.~
@7715 = ~It is definitely not fair, but I am sure that she would do same for you if she could.~
@7716 = ~I know, because I know that she is just as strong as you are, perhaps even stronger.~
@7717 = ~This is no time to despair, <CHARNAME>. Sure, you can just lie down and die, but I seriously doubt that you will.~
@7718 = ~Your sister loves you dearly, you know that. And she would do anything to save you. Together you will get through all this.~
@7719 = ~Besides, you have some pretty good friends looking after you... Trust me, it will be all right. I won't leave you in trouble all alone. We will find Bodhi and reclaim what she has taken.~
@7720 = ~I-I just can't... *Sniff* I do not know if I...*SOB*!~
@7721 = ~Thank you for listening. Amber. It is good to know that I have with me someone that I can count on.~
@7722 = ~(Amber does not say anything, but puts her arms around you and holds you close until your tears have dried up. She pulls a clean napkin seemingly out of nowhere and offers it to you.)~
@7723 = ~Thank you, Amber. I feel much better now.~
@7724 = ~Ahem.... I think we should get going.~
@7725 = ~Glad that I could be of help, <CHARNAME>.~
@7726 = ~Well, I had just arrived in the city and I heard that there was something happening on Waukeen's Promenade. Something involving the Cowled Wizards taking down a powerful mage. I suppose that should have been warning enough to keep my nose out of it - powerful mages are seldom good news - but against my better judgement I decided to take a look.~
@7727 = ~There was nothing much left to see when I arrived, though. Just a large pile of rocks, really. But the air was so thick with magical energy that it made my skin prickle. I left the scene, but apparently one of the officers on guard spotted me and ordered his men to track me down and capture me.~
@7728 = ~I did make them work long and hard for that capture though, but eventually they managed to outwit me. I was quite surprised that they did, actually, but it has been a long time since I was this far south and Athkatla has changed a lot since my last visit. It turned out that the officer thought that I might have been something unnatural that escaped from that mage's dungeon when it collapsed.~
@7729 = ~I was just fashioning a lockpick from some rat bones when you arrived.~
@7730 = ~So, would not a 'thank you' be in order here?~
@7731 = ~Interesting story, Amber. Thank you for sharing it with me. ~
@7732 = ~Well, hopefully you learned your lesson: too much curiosity can get you into trouble.~
@7733 = ~Actually it was me who escaped from that dungeon. So, it seems it was only fitting that I rescued you.~
@7734 = ~Actually it was us who escaped from that dungeon. So, it seems that it was only fitting that we rescued you.~
@7735 = ~I don't think that I asked for your help, <CHARNAME>. Your arrival certainly was timely and saved me some trouble, but I would have found my way out even without you - make no mistake about that. I will show you gratitude when there is reason for it.~
@7736 = ~I really didn't find it that fascinating, but whatever keeps you entertained.~
@7737 = ~And what might have been the thing that lead you to the prison and me? That would not have been curiosity, would it?~
@7738 = ~Is that so? A curious coincidence, indeed. At least I don't have to feel indebted to you for your trouble.~
@7739 = ~What exactly do you want to know? Bear in mind that I have never even met another of my kind. And they do say that no two tieflings are alike, so don't except me to know everything.~
@7740 = ~What exactly do you want to know? Bear in mind that before joining your party I had never even met anyone of my kind. And they do say that no two tieflings are alike, so don't except me to know everything.~
@7741 = ~So, spit it out. What would you like to know?~
@7742 = ~What was it that you said earlier about tieflings being born as a result of a demonic presence touching their ancestors?~
@7743 = ~No two tieflings are alike, you say? What do you mean by that?~
@7744 = ~How come you have not met anyone of your kind? Are tieflings just so rare or have you been deliberately avoiding them?~
@7745 = ~How come you had not met anyone of your kind before joining this party? Are tieflings just so rare or have you been deliberately avoiding them?~
@7746 = ~If tieflings are born as a result of a demonic presence touching their ancestors, like you mentioned earlier, what about those touched by an angelic presence? Are they considered tieflings too? ~
@7747 = ~Never mind, I don't think we have time for this right now, after all.~
@7748 = ~That certainly cleared some things up. I don't think there was anything else I wanted to know right now. Let's move on.~
@7749 = ~Well, as far as I know there are two ways. The traditional way where a fiend or a half-fiend mates with an unfortunate human - often against his or her will. Apparently tieflings can also be born to what you would call normal parents if one or both of the parents have visited a plane outside the Prime Material and thus exposed themselves to something you could call 'cross-plane contamination' or something similar.~
@7750 = ~What about your origins? Do you know which one was the case with you?~
@7751 = ~Prime Material Plane?~
@7752 = ~You said 'human'. Aren't there tieflings of dwarven or elven ancestry, for example?~
@7753 = ~I see. There was still something else I wanted to know about tieflings in general.~
@7754 = ~I honestly don't know. I never knew my parents, so I could not even ask them. But I have read that tieflings born to plane-touched parents tend to reflect the nature of the plane in question - whatever that is supposed to mean - and that they are the craziest of tieflings. (Amber smiles ironically on the word 'crazy'.)~
@7755 = ~So, I suppose I could be of the first kind, since tieflings with demonic ancestry are supposed to have physical features resembling those of the demon or demons in their lineage: wings, tails, horns and such. I know that many demons have catlike eyes, are resistant to fire and can make bizarre things happen to their enemies just by looking at them.~
@7756 = ~I don't know if any have these kinds of markings, though. (Amber points to a strange tattoo-like marking currently nestling on her wrist. It looks like a small dragon curled up into a ball. You know it to be impossible, but the suddenly the dragon figure looks more like a crouching feline. It looks almost as if irritated by the sudden attention and disappears into Amber's sleeve.)~
@7757 = ~Was there anything else you wanted to know about the extraordinary ways tieflings can come to existence, <CHARNAME>? (You are not sure if Amber is mocking you or not.)~
@7758 = ~You mentioned the Prime Material Plane. What is that?~
@7759 = ~You said tieflings can result from the union of a human and a demon. Aren't there tieflings of for example dwarven or elven ancestry?~
@7760 = ~You are standing on it - at least most of the time, I guess. I am not exactly an expert on planes beyond the Prime Material, but they are supposed to represent the different aspects of good, evil, law, chaos and neutrality. (Amber frowns.) I think there are other planes besides them as well, and I have heard of a place - a City of Doors they say - that is supposed to be the crossroads of the multiverse or something. It is quite fascinating, really.~
@7761 = ~You said there were two kinds of tieflings. Do you know which kind you are?~
@7762 = ~As far as I know, there are no restrictions as to which race the non-fiend party can be. I suppose human tieflings are more common just because humans are more likely to fall prey to the machinations of fiends than halflings, for example.~
@7763 = ~Well, for example these lovely little demonic streaks in my appearance are in all probability a direct indication of the nature of my demonic ancestor. However, since the traits can manifest themselves in such variety of ways, you are not likely to find two tieflings with exactly similar appearances and abilities.~
@7764 = ~The magnitude of the physical features probably depends on how close the fiendish relative is, but I don't think that there is a hard and fast rule to that. For all I know, someone of your neighbours could very well be the son of a demon prince. But as an answer to the question you were about to ask next: no, I do not know what demon gave me my *wonderful* appearance or how many generations ago that was.~
@7765 = ~Well, judging on your looks, I bet you grandmother was a succubus.~
@7766 = ~I am not quite stupid enough to take that as a compliment. If you think there is something even remotely funny about all this, we might as well end this discussion.~
@7767 = ~As I told you before, tieflings are in fact quite rare here on the Prime Material Plane, and I would imagine that even those few would be especially careful in hiding their out of place appearance here. After all, you could never count on the other tiefling not to turn you in to some silly witch hunters in order to save his own sorry skin. It would be interesting to discuss this with someone who has travelled the planes and seen more of the places beyond the borders of this world.~
@7768 = ~I see. There was something else I wanted to know about tieflings in general.~
@7769 = ~(Amber shrugs.) No, they are something called aasimar. Rather conceited folk, as I understand. Luckily, I have not crossed paths with one, yet.~
@7770 = ~Why would you not want to cross paths with an aasimar?~
@7771 = ~Why would you call them conceited?~
@7772 = ~Well, I have heard that some of them harbour a very nasty attitude towards tieflings. There are those aasimar who consider it to be their holy duty to wipe the world clean of our accursed taint. While I am sure it would be *splendid* to meet one of the more tolerant ones, I think it is better to be safe than sorry.~
@7773 = ~ I see. There was something else I wanted to know about tieflings in general.~
@7774 = ~Knowing you are descended from something that represents absolute good and righteousness can easily lead to the false synecdoche of considering yourself to *be* absolutely good and righteous; or at least better than everyone else. This tends to make them forget that in the end it is your actions that determine who you truly are. Which in my book translates to a pretty good definition of conceit.~
@7775 = ~Of course, I am not saying that all aasimar are like that - most likely  not. But as I said, I have never crossed paths with one and I really do not care to.~
@7776 = ~That certainly cleared some things up. I don't think there was anything else I wanted to know right now. Let's move on~
@7777 = ~What makes you say that, <CHARNAME>?~
@7778 = ~I have been observing how you treat other members of this group and I'm afraid to say that I see lot of prejudice on your part.~
@7779 = ~Well, to give you an example, you seem to think very little of aasimar even though you have never met one.~
@7780 = ~Well, you know, I just get the feeling that you are being a bit of a hypocrite.~
@7781 = ~Never mind actually, I don't know what I was thinking when I said that.~
@7782 = ~Fair enough. I don't think that I have ever claimed to be perfect. Giving others the benefit of the doubt is merely an ideal I'm trying to meet and yes, I hope that others will extend me the same courtesy. I suppose that on my part it is a constant battle between personal experience and the ideal. You should realise that very few have met a tiefling before, so the bigotry I'm faced with is based on hearsay and nothing more.~
@7783 = ~Of course that is no excuse for my own prejudices, but as I said, I have no illusions of being perfect. However, I do think that I am able to re-evaluate my opinions of others and apologise if I have judged someone unfairly.~
@7784 = ~Does this satisfy you?~
@7785 = ~Well, I think you should try a little harder to be more considerate towards others.~
@7786 = ~I don't think that a good explanation at all. You are just a hypocrite and that's it.~
@7787 = ~Yes, it does. I appreciate your honesty.~
@7788 = ~I can only do my best, but I will try.~
@7789 = ~Are you trying to pick a fight, <CHARNAME>? I shall refrain from returning the insult, if only to lead by example. At least I know when to stop.~
@7790 = ~Any time, <CHARNAME>.~
@7791 = ~Do thieves like guards even if they have never been caught? Call it fear if you will, but I would rather stay out of their way.~
@7792 = ~Thieves have a real reason to assume that guards will not take kindly to them. They would not be called thieves if they had not stolen something, would they?~
@7793 = ~I guess you do have a point. Thank you for explaining it to me.~
@7794 = ~All right, it wasn't such a good analogy. Perhaps I should put it in another way: Take angels and demons. Do the celestial and the fiendish co-operate? Do they go and have tea together? No? Aasimar and tieflings are descendants of those two polar opposites, and the strain between the two is not much less.~
@7795 = ~But you always say that we make our own destinies? How does that go together with what you just said?~
@7796 = ~Yes, I do say that quite often don't I. And it is something that I am desperately clinging on to, but who knows - maybe it's just a lie that I am trying to make myself believe.~
@7797 = ~Now you will have to excuse me before I dig myself any deeper into contradiction.~
@7798 = ~I do not need to excuse my behaviour to you unless you have something to back your accusations with.~
@7799 = ~Well, perhaps you should think twice before saying something like that.~
@7800 = ~I thought I already told you that they are not tattoos. Not in the conventional sense, at least. I fail to see the point of this, but go ahead and ask.~
@7801 = ~Have they always been there?~
@7802 = ~Is there a pattern to how they change? Do they reflect your current mood or something?~
@7803 = ~I was just wondering, how far down do those patterns go?~
@7804 = ~Never mind, then. I see that you're not in the mood to discuss this. ~
@7805 = ~Well, yes and no. As you've probably noticed, the intensity of my 'tattoos' - as you call them - can vary a lot: from strong and dark to almost imperceptible. When I was younger they were rarely even visible, but during past few decades they have grown... stronger, if you will.~
@7806 = ~Not one that I know of. So answer to you question would be: no, you cannot interpret my emotional state based on the patterns on my skin. The whole idea is rather ridiculous, if you ask me.~
@7807 = ~Far enough, <CHARNAME>. Don't push your luck.~
@7808 = ~Whatever you say, <CHARNAME>.~
@7809 = ~Jill's family was originally from the city of Luskan, and she was my best friend for many years. I miss her very much. There is so much about her I could tell you. What exactly would you want to hear about?~
@7810 = ~How did you meet Jill?~
@7811 = ~What kind of a person was she?~
@7812 = ~What sort of a bard was Jill? A singer? Or perhaps an actor?~
@7813 = ~Never mind, actually. I think that was about everything I wanted to know about her for now.~
@7814 = ~Was there something else?~
@7815 = ~What sort of a bard was Jill? A singer? Or perhaps an actor? ~
@7816 = ~She saved me from a rather miserable fate at the hands of an angry mob. I had completely by accident managed to temporarily blind a high ranking nobleman, you see. He was not very pleased about it - as you may well imagine - and raised a rather disproportionate fuss about the affair. Of course things turned from bad to worse when a silly peasant woman figured that it must have been me giving her husband the evil eye that caused him to fancy a barmaid over her. I had never even seen the man!~
@7817 = ~Suddenly there were all these accusations flying around and for a moment I really thought that it was the end of the road for me. Then this girl in a dirty tunic and patched up trousers suddenly shows up and single-handedly calms down the mob. To this day I have no idea *how* she did it, but Jill actually managed to convince them that the nobleman who started the whole mess was actually in league with a powerful evil sorcerer and was planing to seize control of the city.~
@7818 = ~Jill then took me to her place and from that day on, we were practically inseparable.~
@7819 = ~Well Jill - or Gillian, as her parents had named her - had a spirit that burned brighter than anyone's I have ever met. Someone who really didn't know her could have called her untrustworthy and wild. A reckless and ignorant girl who cared nothing for others. But I would rather say that she was adventurous and daring - and fiercely loyal to those she loved. Even though she occasionally had to be reminded about certain aspects of civil behaviour, she was never as bad as many liked to think.~
@7820 = ~Besides, she was everything but ignorant. Not only could she beat the most refined of courtiers in games of courtesy and carry on an intelligent debate with a scholar of any discipline, but she was also wise in the ways of the streets and always knew the latest news about town - usually well before the town criers.~
@7821 = ~She was someone who could begin an evening as the queen of an aristocratic ball, dazzling everyone with her grace and charm, and end it drinking dwarves under the table in a dirty riverside tavern. She did always prefer the latter, however, to the eternal disappointment of her elder brother Tristan, who never cared much for her rather tomboyish attitude to life.~
@7822 = ~I take it that you did not really like this Tristan, then.~
@7823 = ~I see. There was something else I wanted to ask about Jill.~
@7824 = ~That certainly cleared some things up. I don't think that there was anything else I wanted to know right now. Let's move on.~
@7825 = ~No, no, you misunderstand me; there was no animosity between us. It is true that Tristan was somewhat suspicious of me at first. But when he saw that it was me who was often talking Jill out of her most reckless ideas - mostly by reminding her that it might once in a while be wise to take other people into account as well - instead of encouraging her, he became a lot more tolerant.~
@7826 = ~We had a sort of silent understanding - we both looked after Jill in our own way and tried not to bother each other too much.~
@7827 = ~Why would you have bothered each other? You just gave me the impression that you two got along all right.~
@7828 = ~Well, Tristan *was* a priest and knight of Lathander and I - an abomination of nature. However, he overlooked that one little detail with great resolve once he got over his initial gut reaction. He was all right as far as silly tinheads go. The best of men, really.~
@7829 = ~Tristan was head over heels in love with this moon elf wizardess, but unfortunately for him, she did not feel the same way, although she cared deeply for him. It was quite tragic, actually, but somehow Tristan managed to never let it affect his behaviour.~
@7830 = ~Oh, Jill could sing well enough, and talk almost anyone into doing almost anything if she really wanted to. She also had a natural knack for magic and eventually became quite proficient in its use. Jill never bothered to study magic that much - well, not at all, actually - but the power seemed to flow through her nevertheless, and she always seemed to have the right spell on her lips.~
@7831 = ~I believe her mother had had similar talents, but she had died when Jill was only a baby. Her elder brother Tristan took care of her for most of their childhood. Their father had a habit of drinking heavily and though they were of a wealthy family, almost all of their fortune was gone when Jill reached adulthood. That's pretty much the reason why she and Tristan eventually took up adventuring.~
@7832 = ~She didn't happen to teach you to sing, or perhaps to cast a spell or two?~
@7833 = ~Oh, no... I don't think that Jill could have taught me to sing even if she had tried to. As for magic - I think that I have enough to do in coping with my own innate talents, thank you very much. Jill did, however, give me a few helpful pointers on how to deal with them: how to control my abilities instead of letting them control me.~
@7834 = ~But most importantly, she taught me to read. That is something for which I could never thank her enough. Being able to read opened a whole new world for me, even though I had to sneak into libraries at night to get a chance to lose myself into the vast universes of fact and fiction contained within their books.~
@7835 = ~You will have to be more specific than that - after all, I did spend almost ten years with them.~
@7836 = ~What did you say the name of the circus was?~
@7837 = ~What exactly were you doing in the circus?~
@7838 = ~How did you end up travelling with the circus in the first place?~
@7839 = ~Did you like working there?~
@7840 = ~Why did you leave?~
@7841 = ~Never mind, actually. I don't think we have the time for this right now.~
@7842 = ~So, what else did you want to know?~
@7843 = ~Why did you leave? ~
@7844 = ~'Amazing Fabrizio's Circus of Miraculous Oddities'. Later on Fabrizio was changed to Bruno, but I left soon after that. We did not get along very well, him and me.~
@7845 = ~I was an acrobat and a trapeze artist. Nadja, one of the acrobats, took me to live in the wagon that she shared with her teenage son. Nadja did not have a husband and there was plenty of room for all three of us. She trained both me and her son as trapeze artists and we eventually became quite good, even though I had loads of catching up to do. Sasha had been training since the age of three.~
@7846 = ~We got a number of our own after about five years of hard work. Nadja would have been so proud of us had she lived to see it. She died... (Amber frowns, as if trying to recall a distant memory.) ...the year Sasha turned seventeen, if I remember correctly. Sad thing for him having neither mom or dad, but one of the best things about living in a circus is the fact that it is very much like a large family, regardless of who is really related to whom. Besides, Sasha's uncle, one of Nadja's brothers, was Fabrizio's beast master, so there was no support missing.~
@7847 = ~I also did some knife tossing, but I seemed to have a knack for the trapeze, so I mainly stuck to that.~
@7848 = ~Well, I just went to one of their shows and... erm... just didn't leave. I don't really know how to explain what happened. I just ended up talking with one of the acrobats after the show and one thing led to another. She asked if I wanted to learn a couple of things and I said yes.  The owner, Fabrizio, was at first a bit reluctant to take me in, but he was a kind old man with heart of gold, so everything turned out well in the end.~
@7849 = ~First of all, you should realise that I really did not consider it as work. Not in the ordinary sense of the word anyway. I would rather think of it as a way of life, and a rich one at that, I'd dare to say. What I really liked about it was that no-one cared about your past - who you used to be, what you used to do or who you used to know. The only thing that mattered were your actions in the present. That was what made you what you were and what you were judged on.~
@7850 = ~The circus was the closest thing to a family that I have ever had, and swinging on the trapeze really is the closest thing to flying... to feeling truly free. I suppose you could say that I was happy there, but of course it was not meant to last. I do not regret leaving, however. There are so many other thing to see and experience - I would not miss them for the world.~
@7851 = ~I had to. Old Fabrizio had died and I did not get along with his nephew, Bruno, who inherited the circus from him. It was his circus, after all, so it was me who had to leave. It was probably for the best - in a tight-knit family like that it is not good to have too much tension between people. Things get ugly too quickly and when it's your loved ones that get hurt, it is worse than with people who are just your colleagues.~
@7852 = ~I thought I told you that I don't remember much about my early childhood. As for Waterdeep - yes - there was this gang of wayward kids that let me hang out with them. When they did not feel like throwing rocks at me, that is.~
@7853 = ~Was that enough or do you need to know something more?~
@7854 = ~So, let me guess: you and this gang picked people's pockets for a living?~
@7855 = ~What is your first childhood memory? Maybe that can give us a clue about your origins.~
@7856 = ~You are saying that the kids threw rocks at you for fun? Ouch. That must have been unpleasant.~
@7857 = ~And how long ago was that? You living in Waterdeep, I mean.~
@7858 = ~What about the city itself? What can you tell me of Waterdeep?~
@7859 = ~I believe that was more than enough. Let's move on.~
@7860 = ~So, let me guess: you and this gang you mentioned picked people's pockets for a living?~
@7861 = ~Well, it's not like there are that many career options for young orphans in any city, and in big cities like Waterdeep problems tend to pile up. It is relatively easy to nick a purse or two when you're working as a group, but it's not like I'm proud of the stuff that happened back then.~
@7862 = ~I suppose that I would be even less proud had I starved to death. though. It does have a way of detracting from that 'smart and resourceful' image, you know.~
@7863 = ~What is it with your obsession about my childhood? Do you remember the time before Gorion took you under his care? No? Well, I thought so. And considering *your* origins, it's probably for the best.~
@7864 = ~But I would really like to know. It's not my fault that Gorion never told me about my past. Come on Amber, certainly there must be something you can tell me about yourself.~
@7865 = ~All right, I get your point. Maybe it is better to leave the past alone.~
@7866 = ~All right. I'll take the hint. I think we have chattered enough for the time being. Let's move on.~
@7867 = ~What is it with your obsession about my childhood? Do you remember everything about yours? No? Well, I thought so. And as far as I'm concerned, that's probably for the best.~
@7868 = ~But I would really like to know. Come on Amber, certainly there must be something you can tell me about yourself.~
@7869 = ~(Amber studies your face intensively for a moment, as if she is trying to evaluate you.) All right, don't laugh at me now, but there is this dream I used to have when I was younger. (Amber hesitates and looks at you for signs of derision.)~
@7870 = ~Please, go on.~
@7871 = ~A dream? Well, perhaps we should just leave it alone. I was hoping you had some hard evidence to share.~
@7872 = ~A dream? Well, perhaps we should just leave it alone. Besides, I think we have chattered enough for the time being. Let's move on.~
@7873 = ~I am somewhere pitch dark, in a cellar or something, under some heavy woollen blankets. There is water somewhere near - I can hear it splashing against the stones. I'm really thirsty, but too scared to go looking for the water. I think I'm hurt too; maybe burnt or something, as the wool blankets chafe my skin.~
@7874 = ~Somebody has soaked the blankets with water before piling them on me. I don't think it was me, because in the dream I am small and scared, and the blankets are big and heavy - way too heavy for me to lift. I can hear the crackle of fire above me - it is overcoming the sound of splashing water. ~
@7875 = ~I get even more scared as the roaring of flames increases. Not really for myself - I am in the cellar, it is underground and made of stone - but for someone else. I don't know who, since I always woke up at that point.~
@7876 = ~(Amber is silent for a moment, lost in a memory, a distant look in her eyes.) *Sigh.* I haven't had that dream in years and years, but it is the first dream I remember.~
@7877 = ~Not really.~
@7878 = ~No, actually I enjoyed it. (Amber rolls her eyes.) Of course it was unpleasant. What kind of a comment was that supposed to be? ~
@7879 = ~Does it really matter? People's attitudes will always be the same - there may be a difference in the degree, but no matter how much time passes, those who are not like others will always provoke fear and loathing in most people.~
@7880 = ~You didn't answer my question, Amber.~
@7881 = ~Well, I was hoping that I had proved that opinion unfounded. ~
@7882 = ~I guess you are right. Most people do tend to be wary of the unusual.~
@7883 = ~Alright, I think we have chattered enough for the time being. Let's move on.~
@7884 = ~And I have no intention of doing so. Time is of no essence here.~
@7885 = ~Well, I did say *most* people. Every rule has its exceptions.~
@7886 = ~It's been so long, practically forever, since I left there, but I can tell you that it is called the City of Splendours for a good reason.~
@7887 = ~People in the adventuring business, like yourself, along with assorted sell-swords and mercenaries, usually find their way to the Virgin's Square. It's one of the market places in the Trades Ward and a traditional hiring place. The locals say that in the old times, virgins were sacrificed to dragons there, hence the name Virgin's Square. It's a great place for finding work, but you'd better keep a close eye on your purse.~
@7888 = ~If, on the other hand, you are up for something shadier, you'd do well to head down to the docks. It kind of makes you wonder; why does a great and important port like Waterdeep have such a derelict harbour? I guess that the lords have either grown too fond of their smuggled goods or just like to have the slums around in order to feel privileged themselves.~
@7889 = ~I think that was quite enough about the city itself, Amber.~
@7890 = ~I think I have heard enough. Let's move on.~
@7891 = ~Interesting - tell me more.~
@7892 = ~I'll soon have to start charging you for my services as a tour guide, <CHARNAME>.~
@7893 = ~If you are more interested in sightseeing than in job opportunities, you'll probably enjoy promenading the Castle Ward or checking out whether there is anything of interest going on at the Field of Triumph in the Sea Ward. It's the best place for watching horse races or displays of skill in magic, if that kind of thing gets you going.~
@7894 = ~The largest of the marketplaces is located in the Castle Ward, but you might be more interested in what the Old Xoblob Shop at the docks has to offer. Assuming it's still there, of course.~
@7895 = ~Well, it has the most extensive collection of Undermountain artefacts anywhere. And then there is of course the stuffed beholder that gave the shop its name that is a sight in itself.~
@7896 = ~In case you are wondering, Undermountain is an ancient Dwarven city that an insane wizard called Halaster found, infested with drow. That was long before Waterdeep was founded, but stories tell that Halaster still lives somewhere deep below the city, protected by a labyrinth full of traps and extraplanar monsters.~
@7897 = ~They also say that the tunnels reach all the way to the endless pits of the Underdark, and that there are secret seaside ports under Waterdeep, where pirates and smugglers come to trade with the drow.~
@7898 = ~Back then, I was never foolish enough to take a look at the place myself. I couldn't say the same any more, but I've just never got around to visiting Waterdeep again.~
@7899 = ~(A shadow passes over Amber's face when you mention the name.) I believe you know everything there is to know about him already. He was Nadja's son from the circus and I did a trapeze number with him.~
@7900 = ~And he died in a trapeze accident... how long ago?~
@7901 = ~I see that you are not comfortable talking about this. I will pry no further into it, then.~
@7902 = ~Ages ago. Was there anything else?~
@7903 = ~Well I guess I just wanted to know if you two were...~
@7904 = ~Lovers? No, it was nothing like that. Now, if you excuse me...  (An expression of regret like you have never seen before crosses Amber's face as she turns away.)~
@7905 = ~I can not help it if the bard attempts to woo me, but I find it somewhat insulting that you should suspect my fidelity, <CHARNAME>.~
@7906 = ~I don't meant to question your fidelity, but if you are not interested in his attentions, I think you should make it clear to him.~
@7907 = ~Why should I believe you?~
@7908 = ~So, you do admit that you think he finds you attractive? Why shouldn't that feeling be mutual?~
@7909 = ~I'm sorry Amber. I should have not questioned your fidelity. Can you forgive me?~
@7910 = ~*If* you are not interested? Where did this sudden outburst of distrust come from? I made it perfectly clear to him that I only wanted to be his friend.~
@7911 = ~But I don't want you to be his friend.~
@7912 = ~What distrust? I'm only asking you to prove that you are serious with me and not thinking about other options.~
@7913 = ~But he could have taken that 'friend' thing as a promise for something more.~
@7914 = ~Well, *I* don't think that you were clear enough. There are friends and then there are *friends*, you know.~
@7915 = ~Because I say so?~
@7916 = ~Because I have no reason to lie to you?~
@7917 = ~Because you are *not* really the idiot you are being right now?~
@7918 = ~I'm sorry, but I don't need to make you believe anything. You'll just have to take me as I am or forget it.~
@7919 = ~Are you breaking up with me?~
@7920 = ~I'm sorry. It's just that I don't want you anywhere near him. I don't want you to be even friends with him.~
@7921 = ~Gee, well, let me think for a minute here.~
@7922 = ~Could it be because I'm in the middle of something with *you* right here?~
@7923 = ~Something that really means a lot to me.~
@7924 = ~That's not good enough for me. I need proof that you are serious with me and not thinking about other options.~
@7925 = ~You need *proof*? Sorry, but I don't need to prove anything to you. You'll just have to take me as I am or forget it.~
@7926 = ~If *he* fails to get the meaning of friendship, it is his problem, not mine or yours for that matter. I cannot control what goes on in his mind.~
@7927 = ~That is not for you to decide. I will not choose my friends based on your tastes. I am what I am and you'll just have to take it or leave it.~
@7928 = ~Are you?~
@7929 = ~Yes.~
@7930 = ~Then I would advise you to stop this foolishness.~
@7931 = ~On second thought, I don't think that I want to go on with you. This is getting way too taxing.~
@7932 = ~In that case, I should leave. This whole mess was a bad idea anyway.~
@7933 = ~No, I still need you as an ally. Please stay.~
@7934 = ~Well, at least there is something we can agree on.~
@7935 = ~Hmph... All right, I'll stay for a while. But don't you think for a second that you can weasel your way back into my favour once the regret gets to you.~
@7936 = ~There's no way in the Nine Hells that am I staying anywhere near you!~
@7937 = ~Just don't expect me to wish you farewell.~
@7938 = ~You don't really need to ask that, do you, <CHARNAME>?~
@7939 = ~What is that supposed to mean?~
@7940 = ~Come on, don't try to deny that there is something going on between you two.~
@7941 = ~I just don't want you to be distracted from our quest.~
@7942 = ~I was just wondering whether he is as good as he keeps insinuating.~
@7943 = ~Nothing. Just forget I said anything.~
@7944 = ~I can not help it if the bard attempts to woo me, but I believe that I have made it perfectly clear that I do not want anything beyond friendship from him.~
@7945 = ~But he could have taken that friendship thing as a promise for something more.~
@7946 = ~Well, I don't think that you have been clear enough. There are friends and then there are *friends*, you know.~
@7947 = ~That's good to hear. I cannot have you getting distracted from the quest.~
@7948 = ~All right, if you're too shy to admit it, then don't.~
@7949 = ~Perhaps I misjudged you; he has obviously failed to impress you.~
@7950 = ~I don't believe I've given you the leave to orchestrate my life.~
@7951 = ~I will not tolerate any sort of intimacy between my underlings. This is serious business we are in.~
@7952 = ~I'm sorry, I didn't mean to insult you. It's just that I really need your help in the task ahead of us.~
@7953 = ~Right. But then again, I'm not exactly your underling. You just try to keep that straight in your head.~
@7954 = ~I'm sorry for snapping at you, <CHARNAME>. Of course I'll help you the best I can.~
@7955 = ~Good in what, exactly?~
@7956 = ~Well, you know... in bed.~
@7957 = ~Well, you know... in swinging his sword?~
@7958 = ~How should I know?~
@7959 = ~Well, should you be talking about his *blades*, I believe you would have noticed that he has two of them. But since you obviously are not...~
@7960 = ~I am afraid that you will have to find that out by yourself. And as to me, I would appreciate if you'd keep your mind out of the gutter.~
@7961 = ~Because I know for certain that as soon as another little bird happens to flutter by, his affections for me will be a thing of the past?~
@7962 = ~Because I am genuinely not interested?~
@7963 = ~Whatever, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb080]
@7964 = ~Indeed he has.~
@7965 = ~Already did.~
@7966 = ~Yes, it was. What about it? Am I about to receive a sermon on the immorality of using such methods?~
@7967 = ~Well, he did look like he was in a great deal of pain when he died. Was that absolutely necessary?~
@7968 = ~Actually I was just wondering where you learned to prepare such powerful poisons.~
@7969 = ~On second thought, never mind. Perhaps we can talk later?~
@7970 = ~Yes, I'm afraid he was... I really had no choice about that and I do feel sorry for him. But certainly you cannot blame me - after all, you have vanquished your fair share of enemies on the battlefield.~
@7971 = ~Yes, but I always try to make a clean kill - quick and painless.~
@7972 = ~I guess you are right, but I was just wondering where you learned to make such powerful poisons.~
@7973 = ~No, I don't think it is the same thing at all. Using poison is just so...  unfair.~
@7974 = ~Surely you aren’t saying that you always succeed in that? We both do the best we can.~
@7975 = ~I guess you are right. Let's get going.~
@7976 = ~And using your demigod powers is fair? No, don't get mad at me. I was just pointing out that neither of us is what you would call 'normal', and sometimes has to resort to more unorthodox means just to survive.~
@7977 = ~Well, I suppose that we can agree to disagree on this matter, then. I still think using poison against your enemies is just plain wrong.~
@7978 = ~No, you are wrong. I would never knowingly use the unholy powers my father's legacy has infected me with.~
@7979 = ~Since when has combat been about being fair? In this line of work one sometimes has to use any means necessary in order to survive. We both know that, and so do all we cross our swords with.~
@7980 = ~No, that's where you are wrong. I always give my enemies a fair chance.~
@7981 = ~But does it really make a difference if your enemies end up dead anyway? ~
@7982 = ~It makes a difference to me. I'm sorry if you can't see that.~
@7983 = ~I've gathered a bit here and another there, but most of it came from the alchemist of the Circus I was living in. Miranda the Red Lady, as she was called, mostly made exploding potions for the fire-eaters, but she knew of many others things as well, and she was more than glad when someone showed interest in her skills. She had lost her son to the plague, so there was no one to continue her work.~
@7984 = ~You might ask why I have taken such interest in poisons, but the explanation is quite simple. I have noticed that people harassing you learn their lesson and leave you alone much quicker if they get a nasty fever as a reminder. The guard at Ymmyrt's place was an unfortunate accident - the selection of ingredients in that room was limited to an extremely poisonous potted plant. A rather rare species, actually.  Unfortunately the only effect you can get out of it is a slow, agonising death. I do feel sorry for him, but I really had no desire to remain in that place for any longer.~
@7985 = ~But I have rambled on for quite long enough, probably enough to bore you.  We should move on, friend.~
@7986 = ~I don't think that disagreeing is necessarily a bad thing, even though this is hardly a trivial matter. However, I don't think that arguing over it here and now will help us get on with our quest.~
@7987 = ~Well, I think that you know her better than I do, <CHARNAME>, but ask away.~
@7988 = ~I lied to her recently, when she asked me whether her scars look ugly to me, and it bothers me.~
@7989 = ~She's so concerned about the scars on her back... I wish I could make her feel more confident about the way she looks.~
@7990 = ~You heard how she yelled at me earlier, didn't you? I was simply trying to comfort her. I... I simply cannot understand women!~
@7991 = ~I'm worried about her. Every day she seems more and more agitated over the loss of her wings. I would have imagined that living the active life of an adventurer would have helped her to get over her pain and regain her will to live, but it seems that we are headed to the opposite direction.~
@7992 = ~I'm so tired of all that whining over her wings. I would have imagined that living a more active life would have  helped her to get over it, but it seems like it's having exactly the opposite effect.~
@7993 = ~You know what happened? We spent the night together and then she abandoned me. I.. I... *sob*~
@7994 = ~The heartless bitch ditched me!~
@7995 = ~I don't know what went wrong. One moment she was all for it and now she thinks we are going too fast. I simply cannot understand women.~
@7996 = ~Teaches you a lesson about lying, doesn't it? You made your bed and now you'll just have to lie in it. There are two things you can do: you can either tell her the truth as soon as you get the chance or keep quiet about it and taste the bitter brew of regret.~
@7997 = ~It's pretty much a no-win situation, <CHARNAME>. Whichever option you choose, you are bound to get burned.~
@7998 = ~But what was I was supposed to say? That she's hideous?~
@7999 = ~I suppose you are right, but I'd rather tell a white lie every now and then than hurt someone's feelings.~
@8000 = ~I suppose you are right, but I think I'll have to tell her the truth, nevertheless.~
@8001 = ~Well, thanks for nothing. I was just hoping that you could understand what I'm going through here.~
@8002 = ~1 I think the real question is: why do you think she's hideous? And more importantly: why should you encourage her to think that your opinion on her looks should matter? You're not really helping her improve her self-confidence - leading here to think that she should find validation through the opinions of others.~
@8003 = ~Are you sure you are not just trying to build up your own ego? It can be an attractive thought - having people depend on your whim and approval, but if that's what you build your self-confidence on, I'd say you are building on sand. And it certainly won't do any good for Aerie.~
@8004 = ~I've never quite understood the alleged difference between a 'white lie' and a plain old fashioned lie of some other colour. I suppose that you are just much smarter than me then, if you think you can avoid getting tangled in a net of lies that keep piling on top of one another.~
@8005 = ~Good for you, then. However, don't expect to get away with it without having to explain her why you opinions change like the weather. Choose your words carefully and with thought. And think even harder about how you treat that girl, she seems just about as tough as a glass vase.  And broken glass can cut you up pretty bad, so you'd better watch out.~
@8006 = ~What do you expect? That I will entertain your self pity when you have acted like an oaf? Think again, <CHARNAME>. And think even harder about how you treat that girl, she seems just about as tough as a glass vase.  And broken glass can cut you up pretty bad, so you'd better watch out.~
@8007 = ~But it's your call, really. I have no real advice to give you on this. ~
@8008 = ~Perhaps *you* should be less concerned about her scars. I don't think that you should encourage her to think that your opinion on her looks should matter to her. You wouldn't really be helping her improve her self-confidence - leading here to think that she should find validation through the opinions of others.~
@8009 = ~Are you sure you are not just trying to build up your own ego? It can be an attractive thought - having people depend on your whim and approval, but if that's what you build your self-confidence on, I'd say you are building on sand. And it certainly wouldn't do any good for Aerie.~
@8010 = ~She will be just fine, don't you worry, <CHARNAME>.~
@8011 = ~I bet that little outburst will be forgotten before you even know it , <CHARNAME>. It's good for her that she has the courage to yell at you, of all people. At least we know that there still is some backbone under all those lost feathers. ~
@8012 = ~Some hurts just need to be worked over before they can be let go, <CHARNAME>. I don't think that she ever really got any healing done in the circus. You have given her a channel to express her grief, but only time will tell if she has the strength to truly put it behind her.~
@8013 = ~If she doesn't... Well, then there is nothing you - or anyone else - can do.~
@8014 = ~<CHARNAME>, I have seen you take blows a lot worse than that little stab at your heart. Aerie is still quite naive and it's probably only for the best if she takes a step back and takes a more objective look around her. Once she has done that, she may see you for who you really are, and not just for an idealised hero who rode to her rescue.~
@8015 = ~Just listen to yourself, <CHARNAME>! If 'heartless' and 'bitch' are the words you use to describe her, she does exactly the right thing in staying away from you. Since I have seen you take blows a lot worse than that little stab at your heart, I'm beginning to suspect, that it was really your pride that is wounded and not your heart.~
@8016 = ~<CHARNAME>, you must understand that Aerie is still quite naive, and it's probably only for the best if she takes a step back and takes a more objective look around her. Once she has done that, she may see you for who you really are, and not just for an idealised hero who rode to her rescue.~
@8017 = ~If you really care for her, you should give her some space to breathe.~
@8018 = ~I'm not sure if you'll be able to appreciate anything I have to say about him, but ask away.~
@8019 = ~I'm so tired of him turning every conversation into one about himself. I think he asked me about Gorion just to get a chance to tell me about his own father and sister.~
@8020 = ~I was just thinking about how lucky I am to have had Gorion take care of me. Anomen's family life sounds really complicated and... sad, to tell you the truth.~
@8021 = ~I don't understand him. I thought we were getting closer, but when we were talking about how he became a priest of Helm, suddenly he just got ticked off for no apparent reason.~
@8022 = ~Do you think that he will pass his test for knighthood? Will the Order accept him?~
@8023 = ~I spent the night in his arms, but he has still not said if he loves me or not. What do you think? Does he love me or does he keep me around just to warm his bed?~
@8024 = ~Most people like to talk about themselves and Anomen is no exception to that rule, quite the opposite. And who would you rather talk about, then? Yourself? And besides, you already know most things about yourself, but hardly anything about him.~
@8025 = ~But if you find him intolerably boring, why don't you just tell him to keep his thoughts to himself?~
@8026 = ~It seems to me that his disappointment with his family is largely due to his own expectations. After all, they are first and foremost unique individuals with their own hopes and desires, not his private support group.~
@8027 = ~I don't think that they have an obligation to be uncomplicated and supportive just because they are your family. Of course it would be nice if you could count on them in times of hardship, but you really cannot demand it of them.~
@8028 = ~Then again, I am hardly the best person to say anything about family affairs...~
@8029 = ~Hmmmm... how should I put this... Anomen is a passionate man, and from the more explosive end of the spectrum, no less. I am willing to bet you a lot, however, that he'll come crawling back to you sooner or later.~
@8030 = ~I'll be honest with you, <CHARNAME>. I don't like him too much, but obviously you do, and therefore I am willing to grant that there may be more to him that meets the eye. Or the ear. Or any of the senses, for that matter.~
@8031 = ~But, if you think you're up to his constant outbursts and apologies, like your men to come in a shiny metal package and think you have the patience to dig the man out of him, he may be just right for you. I guess good relationships can grow out of rather odd matches.~
@8032 = ~I don't pretend to know anything about the criteria that the Order uses to accept or refuse its members. Should enthusiasm be all that's required, he would definitely be in, but I think it's going to take something more than that.~
@8033 = ~Those are just words, <CHARNAME>. You should judge him by his actions, not by his words. Does he treat you as if he loves you or as if you're just a blanket against the cold night?~
@8034 = ~I'm tempted to say that in his case you will always be second best, himself being his dearest beloved. But then again, how can you ever expect someone else to love you if you don't love yourself? I admit that he has been rather too faithful to that piece of advice, but now I'm really saying too much. I don't think you really want to hear how little I care for him.~
@8035 = ~Just trust your instincts, <CHARNAME>. You should spend less time worrying about how he feels about you and more time enjoying the man himself.~
@8036 = ~I'm afraid that I can't be of much help on that topic - I don't think that you can ever really *know* the Underdark. And if you're lucky, you'll never know it even exists.~
@8037 = ~But if you care to elaborate your question a bit, I may be able to tell you something.~
@8038 = ~Have you ever been in here before?~
@8039 = ~What do you know of the inhabitants of the Underdark?~
@8040 = ~Never mind, actually.~
@8041 = ~No, only on the outskirts when I was travelling with Jill and the others. But I have never been this deep down. Not that it would be of much help even if I had; we were in the far north at that time. I don't think that our detour has taken us quite that far off course.~
@8042 = ~How do you know how deep we are? The way outside could be around the next corner for all we know.~
@8043 = ~I see. Can you tell me what do you know of the inhabitants of the Underdark?~
@8044 = ~That's all I wanted to know right now.~
@8045 = ~Not quite. The shark-men village was *below* the seabed, remember? And we descended even further from there. So, I'd say that we're pretty deep in the bowels of the earth right now.~
@8046 = ~Well, you may be right, but I guess we won't find that out anytime soon. But as long as we're here, can you tell me what do you know of the inhabitants of the Underdark?~
@8047 = ~I don't think so. It might be just a hunch, but I'd say that we're pretty deep in the bowels of the earth right now.~
@8048 = ~Only that they are plenty, and if any of them are happy to see you, it's only because they're hungry.~
@8049 = ~Apart from that, I - like most people in the adventuring business - have heard of the drow, duergar and svirfneblin. They're usually thought of as the more civilised inhabitants of the Underdark.~
@8050 = ~Of course the mindflayers and the beholders are no less intelligent - perhaps even more so. Both of these are, however, also known to inhabit dungeons closer to the surface, and are not usually considered to be as characteristic of the Underdark as the dark cousins of surface elves, dwarves and gnomes.~
@8051 = ~Can you tell me what you know of the drow?~
@8052 = ~Can you tell me what you know of the duergar?~
@8053 = ~Can you tell me what you know of the svirfneblin?~
@8054 = ~What about the monsters that prey in these caverns? Umber hulks, kuo-toa and the like?~
@8055 = ~I see. Can I ask you something else of the Underdark, then?~
@8056 = ~I don't think I know anything you wouldn't. They live in communities led mostly by females, and their society is built on deceit and ambition. Apparently everything depends pretty much on how much the Spider Queen happens to favour your house at a given time, which may vary widely from one moment to the next. The drow shun sunlight, but are well capable of fighting even in magical darkness where eyesight is of little use.~
@8057 = ~That's pretty much what I've heard as well, but please go on. ~
@8058 = ~Right. Could you tell me more about the other inhabitants of the Underdark.~
@8059 = ~In the elven language there is a word - 'dhaerow' - that means 'traitor', and it has been suggested that the 'drow' would have got their name from that. I find it curious that they would take pride in calling themselves 'traitors', as if that would be something to be proud of. Or maybe they just feel proud of the fact that they are forever separated from their surfacer kin, who knows.~
@8060 = ~Please go on. ~
@8061 = ~As for the treason they've committed - there are many stories and legends about how they came to live in the Underdark. I once read a fairly eloquently written history that described how the goddess Araushnee - who we now know as Lloth - betrayed the Creator and God of all Elves, Correllon. The tale about their daughter Eilistraee being lured into the ploy and being banished along with her mother and their followers was quite tragic, actually.~
@8062 = ~The same history gave the impression that the dark skin and pearly white hair of the drow were given to them as a reminder of that betrayal. There were also vague references to powerful spells that elven priests could cast upon someone of their kin who had performed an act that was too severe to be punishable by normal means. That spell would turn the unfortunate elf into a drow.~
@8063 = ~I find it rather harsh to punish not only the supposed wrongdoer, but all his descendants as well. But maybe that's what you get for involving yourself in arguments among the deities.~
@8064 = ~People often claim that all drow are inherently evil, but I'm not sure I'm willing to buy that. Their society certainly does its best to raise them that way, but if you'd take a newborn baby... ~
@8065 = ~*Sigh* I cannot say if that would make much of a difference. Even if you took her away, she would always be different from those around her; a member of a race everyone *thinks of* as evil. She would probably grow bitter and spiteful because of all the prejudice she would have to face. Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy.~
@8066 = ~The drow are actually somewhat depressing as a topic... Perhaps you would like to talk about something else?~
@8067 = ~Like who?~
@8068 = ~I know that they're also called grey dwarves due their ashen skin. I don't know whether they are less numerous than the drow or just make significantly less noise about themselves, but there is nowhere near as much written about the duergar as there is about the drow.~
@8069 = ~The duergar are supposed to be fearless in combat and able to sustain immense amounts of pain. They're deeply engaged in the constant battle over the supremacy of Underdark, and even the drow think twice before risking a battle with the duergar.~
@8070 = ~Please go on.~
@8071 = ~Like the drow, the duergar are known to make raids under the cover of the night on their surface dwelling cousins, especially on the hill dwarves.~
@8072 = ~Sheesh, I'm starting to sound like a textbook. Maybe you'd want to talk about something else?~
@8073 = ~We met a group of deep gnomes once when I was travelling with Jill, her brother and a few other people They had wandered quite far from their home and I think they were a bit lost, but they agreed to help us nevertheless. They were very suspicious of us at first, and I don't think they ever really lowered their guard while we were around.~
@8074 = ~I guess that's just the kind of attitude that keeps you alive in the Underdark. It was damn near that we didn't end up fighting with them, but it was Tristan's patience that saved us and got the gnomes to help us. It was a good thing too - I don't think we would have lived through the day without their help. We had already fought a horde of monsters before we ran into the gnomes and were quite heavily wounded and had spent all of our magic.~
@8075 = ~So, that's how I learned that not all creatures living down here necessarily want to spill your guts. Apparently the svirfneblin are a shy folk and there are stories of vast underground cities whose locations the gnomes won't reveal even under torture. I guess that's a very sensible attitude considering the kinds of neighbours they have.~
@8076 = ~But, as I said, the svirfneblin are rather secretive folk and I don't think that their ways are too well known by outsiders. Did you want to know anything else?~
@8077 = ~Well, from what I have heard, I'd say that the kuo-toa are more of a people - even though a strange one - than monsters. But unlike the other races of the Underdark, perhaps apart from the svirfneblin, I don't think they are a major force in the battle over Underdark's dominance. Although I have heard that they sometimes make raids on seashore villages.~
@8078 = ~And based on what I've heard of the umber hulks, they don't seem to be driven by much else than their own survival  - they don't plot or make special plans for your demise.~
@8079 = ~I've also read about a variant of umber hulks that live underwater, but I think it's possible that the writers confused them with something else...~
@8080 = ~Was that enough or was there something else you wanted to ask about?~
@8081 = ~What do you want to know? ~
@8082 = ~Then we'd better get going. We would do well to keep our attention on our surroundings.~
@8083 = ~(By no means a beauty queen by any usual standards, Amber nevertheless has a certain grace and attractiveness about her that cannot be denied. Her trim body and the way she moves with a perfectly balanced catlike poise cannot be missed even by a casual observer. Though petite, she has long, finely turned limbs and you know that she is definitely not a pushover on the battlefield.)~
@8084 = ~(You feel as if you could go on forever just watching her, but you are forced to tear you attention away from her when her amber eyes turn to look directly at yours, silently but forcefully questioning the appropriateness of your stare.)~
@8085 = ~(You concentrate on studying her face. To casual observation - in the unlikely event that one could tear one's gaze away from her extraordinary eyes - her face might seem pretty at best. A less casual look, however, especially one oft repeated, reveals that her face is, in fact, much beyond mere prettiness in a very unique way.)~
@8086 = ~(Amber has a long, delicate neck and a fine jaw line. Her full lips rarely curve into a smile, but when that happens, her whole face seems to light up. Above her mouth are found a perfectly proportioned nose and high, shapely cheekbones.)~
@8087 = ~(The long eyelashes and delicately curved eyebrows framing her remarkable almond-shaped eyes are a light reddish brown, though not quite as fiery as the flame-kissed locks crowning her features. Regretful of having to continue your journey, you turn your eyes from her and try to focus on the task at hand.)~
@8088 = ~(Your eyes trace the strange tattoo-like shapes covering Amber's body. You have noticed that sometimes they are very clear, even intense, while at other times they are hardly discernible at all. They also appear to intermittently change their shape and position. At first this seemed slightly disturbing, but you have to admit to yourself that in fact they are, in fact, an essential part of her unique allure.)~
@8089 = ~(One of the markings on her shoulder catches your attention as it shifts itself into a new, delicate formation before your very eyes. Hypnotised, you continue to stare at her shoulder and the exotic dance-like play of the patterns. A small disappointed sigh escapes your lips as the shapes finally seem to fade from your view, and you turn to continue your travels.)~
@8090 = ~(Your attention is drawn to Amber's red hair - the way it frames her delicate face and flows down onto her shoulders and cascades down below her tiny waist. You cannot but marvel at its vibrant and intense tones of red and copper. You do not remember ever before witnessing such magnificent hues in anyone's hair.)~
@8091 = ~(The colours look like they are stolen from the flaming sun rising on the morning sky or from the glowing embers of a hot fireplace from which the last flames are slowly dying. You suddenly find yourself fighting back the urge to touch her hair.)~
@8092 = ~What are you grinning at? Is there something funny in what you are seeing?~ [m#amb301]
@8093 = ~What is it that's so hilarious? Why don't you share the joke with us, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb302]
@8094 = ~(Amber seems uncertain of how to react to your smile. Apparently she is not sure whether you are making fun of her or whether your gesture has some other intention.)~
@8095 = ~(Amber flashes an impish smile back at you.) All right, why don't you just tell me what's on your mind, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb303]
@8096 = ~You should smile more often, <CHARNAME>.  It really lights up your features. And you have a beautiful smile to boot.~ [m#amb304]
@8097 = ~(Your smile is rewarded with an equally radiant one on Amber's part. Smiling rarely fails to enhance people's looks, and Amber is no exception. Her eyes shine with happiness as she draws close to you.)~
@8098 = ~I am so glad that I met you, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb306]
@8099 = ~(Amber looks back at you with a bold stubbornness and you realise that most people never dare to look her into the eyes, and even those who do are only trying to prove to themselves or others that they are not afraid of this little 'demon'.)~
@8100 = ~(Afraid of making her uncomfortable, you turn your gaze away only to realise that you have just proven yourself to be like all those others that shun her for her inhuman eyes. You try to meet her eyes again but Amber has already turned away.)~
@8101 = ~(Amber blinks her eyes once, clearly surprised to find you looking her in the eyes. You smile at her, trying to make her feel more at ease.) What are you looking at, <CHARNAME>? And why are you smiling like a goof? Is there something funny in what you see? (She quickly turns and marches away.)~ [m#amb305]
@8102 = ~(For some reason Amber seems to avoid looking at you, but after trying for a while, you manage to briefly lock eyes with her. To your surprise, this time she is actually the one to turn her gaze away first. You could swear her cheeks flush with a light rosy hue.)~
@8103 = ~(Amber returns your gaze with a brief, almost shy glance that stands in strange contrast to her usual self.)~
@8104 = ~(You lock eyes with Amber and she smiles at you, her eyes filled with trust and tender feelings for you.)~
@8105 = ~(Looking deep into Amber's unusual eyes, you try to count all the hues of red, yellow and brown that together make up the iridescent amber colour that you have grown to love. It is a hopeless task, but you don't mind losing yourself in those bright and affectionate eyes.)~
@8106 = ~Hey! Just keep your hands to yourself! (Amber slaps your hand away.)~ [m#amb307]
@8107 = ~Um... What do you think you're doing? (Amber hides her hand behind her back and moves further away from you. It is - in fact - sort of cute.)~ [m#amb308]
@8108 = ~That's my hand, mind you, and I would rather keep it near my weapon in case... In case we're ambushed.~ [m#amb309]
@8109 = ~(Amber lets you hold her hand, sort of, anyway. After a few moments, she begins squirm uncomfortably and moves away from you.)~
@8110 = ~(Amber's hand is slender and warm, and holding it feels very comforting.)~
@8111 = ~(You take a moment to examine Amber's hand, her long fingers and almost unbreakable almond-shaped nails. There is a small scar on her right ring finger, but other than that the skin of her hand is next to flawless. Amber shifts her hand about uncomfortably, indicating that she is not used to being examined so closely. You place a tender kiss on her palm before letting go of her hand.)~
@8112 = ~(Amber takes your hand and entwines her long, delicate fingers with yours, gently yet determinedly squeezing your hand in hers.)~
@8113 = ~(Amber takes the hand you offer her, but instead of simply entwining her fingers with yours, she brings your hand to her lips. Involuntary shivers ripple down your spine as she not only kisses you fingers, but almost imperceptibly licks and gently nibbles them with her lips.)~
@8114 = ~(As you innocently reach to touch Amber's vibrant red hair, she spins around before you can react and grabs your hand. The look she gives you is full of suspicion.) What are you trying to do here, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb310]
@8115 = ~You are not the first spellcaster trying to pinch my hair for his nasty hocus pocus tricks. I would like to point out that the fact that you are occasionally being nice to me does not grant you any privileges. (After giving you a menacing glance, Amber turns away, nervously running her hand through her hair as if checking it is all still there.)~ [m#amb311]
@8116 = ~Learned it from some petty mageling, did you? Whoever he is, you can run back and tell him that no, he cannot have a lock of my hair for his nasty hocus pocus tricks. (After giving you a menacing glance, Amber turns away, nervously running her hand through her hair as if checking it is all still there.)~ [m#amb312]
@8117 = ~(Amber squirms nervously as you brush your fingers through the long strands of her hair.)~
@8118 = ~I am not sure that I am altogether comfortable with that just yet, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb313]
@8119 = ~(You reach to brush a runaway lock of hair from Amber's cheek back behind her pointed ear. Before turning away, your hand lingers for a moment on the elegant curve of her jaw, your eyes locked with hers. A gentle smile plays on her lips as she turns her head away, leaving your fingers tingling with the tantalising softness of her skin.)~
@8120 = ~(You are mesmerised by the softness of her hair as you brush your fingers through it. You wonder how it is possible for someone to have hair with such an unearthly, silky feel, and yet there is something strangely familiar about it.)~
@8121 = ~(You wince involuntarily when you remember the demonic succubus on the upper levels of Durlag's Tower who was trying to convince you to give a lock of her hair to an unwary traveller. Her hair was just as silky and soft as Amber's.)~
@8122 = ~What sort of a question is that?~ [m#amb314]
@8123 = ~I was just wondering...~
@8124 = ~Nevermind actually, forget what I just said.~
@8125 = ~Well, as far as I'm concerned, you can keep on doing so.~ [m#amb315]
@8126 = ~What makes you think that I would tell you even if I had?~ [m#amb316]
@8127 = ~Hmmm... That's a bit of a personal question don't you think?~ [m#amb317]
@8128 = ~Well... a lady has to have her secrets, doesn't she?~ [m#amb318]
@8129 = ~Well, I know I am now, and that's all that matters.~ [m#amb319]
@8130 = ~I think you know the answer to that question all too well, <CHARNAME>. Or do you wish me to remind you?~ [m#amb320]
@8131 = ~(Your fingertips barely touch Amber's shoulder when she bolts away, throwing a half confused, half angry look at you.) You'd better not try something like that again, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb321]
@8132 = ~(Your hand is met with an angry slap.) I thought that you'd value your hands more than that. Keep them away from me, or you might regret it. (Besides irritation, there is also another element in Amber's tone of voice that you cannot quite put your finger on.)~ [m#amb322]
@8133 = ~(You casually wrap your arm around Amber's shoulders as you walk beside her. Her body stiffens instantly and her eyes throw a questioning glare at you, but she does not pull away. After a while, her tension eases and she slides her arm around your waist, drawing you closer.)~
@8134 = ~(You gently slide your hand down Amber's back. She shivers slightly under your touch, but does nothing to stop you.  Encouraged, you rest your hand on her hip - Amber allows this, but you can hear the sound of a sudden intake of breath from her lips.)~
@8135 = ~(Amber flashes a beaming smile at you when you wrap your arm around her waist and pull her near you. You feel her hair tickle your neck as she rests her head on your shoulder.)~
@8136 = ~(Walking beside Amber, you rest your hand on the curve of her hip. Her hips sway delightfully on every step she takes.)~
@8137 = ~(You put your arms around Amber and after a moment's hesitation, she leans forward and hugs you back. You can feel her breasts pressing against your chest and the curve of her hip under your hand. Her body feels warm and soft against yours.)~
@8138 = ~(The sudden rush of desire takes you by surprise, and embarrassed, you pull away from her. Amber first looks at you with a puzzled look in her eyes, but after one look at your face, a knowing smile plays across her lips and you could swear that there is a wicked twinkle in the corner of her eye.)~
@8139 = ~(With one swift move, you manage to catch the ever alert tiefling into your arms. She struggles for a moment, but makes no real effort to escape your grasp. After a moment she relaxes and lets you hold her close.)~
@8140 = ~(Gently caressing her back, you bury your face in her hair. She smells of leather and flowers, and you cannot help smiling at the odd combination and its appropriateness: you have never met anyone so strong, tough and resilient, yet so very delicate and fragile at the same time.)~
@8141 = ~(Placing your hands around her waist, you lift Amber high into the air. She lets out a cute shriek of surprise, but it takes her only a second to recover from the momentary shock, and within the blink of an eye you find yourself lying on your back on the ground, with Amber sitting on your chest.)~
@8142 = ~I would have thought that you'd know better than to try something like that on me. I'd better not catch you trying it again.~ [m#amb323]
@8143 = ~(Amber tries to keep her voice on the threatening side of serious, but cannot quite keep from laughing. A lock of her long hair is caressing your cheek, and you can smell the sweet scent of her hair and feel her breath on your face. You immediately decide to disobey her on the first chance you get.)~
@8144 = ~Now get up, oh clumsy one.~ [m#amb324]
@8145 = ~(Amber hops off your chest and offers her hand to help you get back on your feet. For a moment you consider pulling her down onto you, but your courage fails and you let her help you up instead.)~
@8146 = ~(You place your arms around Amber, drawing her into a gentle embrace. She curls against your chest and you can almost imagine her purring softly.)~
@8147 = ~(Amber responds by wrapping her arms around you.) I hope everything is all right, my love?~ [m#amb325]
@8148 = ~(When you wrap your arms around her, Amber leans forward and gently nuzzles your neck. She runs her hands down your spine and her soft lips tease the sensitive skin of your neck. You can feel her eyelashes tickle your cheek and you smile just for the sheer joy of the sensation.)~
@8149 = ~(You can feel Amber's heartbeat as you draw her lithe body against yours. Somehow that calm, steady rhythm feels very comforting, and you wish you could hold her there forever.)~
@8150 = ~(You see a mix of surprise and suspicion reflected in Amber's eyes as you run your fingers along the side of her face.)~
@8151 = ~Do I have something on my face, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb326]
@8152 = ~Yeah, there seems to be something right there... (Pretend to look more closely and lick your thumb as if preparing to rub her cheek with it.)~
@8153 = ~I thought there was, but I guess it was just a shadow.~
@8154 = ~No... I just couldn't resist the urge to feel the softness of your skin.~
@8155 = ~(Amber quickly steps back and vigorously starts rubbing her cheek.) I-I can clean it up myself, thank you very much. Thanks for pointing it out, however.~ [m#amb327]
@8156 = ~Well, we wouldn't want me running around with a dirty face, now would we? (Amber gives you a wry smile as she turns away from you.)~ [m#amb328]
@8157 = ~Well, I'd prefer if you warned me before touching my face.~ [m#amb329]
@8158 = ~Well, I hope it met your expectations. (Amber smiles at you demurely.)~ [m#amb330]
@8159 = ~Well, I would wager that it is not the only part of me whose softness you cannot resist. (Amber flashes you an enticing smile.)~ [m#amb331]
@8160 = ~(As you brush Amber's cheek with the palm of your hand her skin feels smooth and flawless under your touch.)~
@8161 = ~(You trace your finger over every curve of Amber's delicate face - her elegant jaw, cheekbones, eyebrows and her pointed ears - following the exotic features of a face by now very familiar to you. You end your exploration by brushing your finger teasingly over her succulent lips.)~
@8162 = ~W-what! Get your hands off me, you brick!~ [m#amb332]
@8163 = ~Hey, get that hand off of me unless you wish to lose it!~ [m#amb333]
@8164 = ~That's it! I've had enough! (Amber slaps you forcefully across the cheek.)~ [m#amb334]
@8165 = ~Is that something you consider to be decent behaviour? Seeing something you like and just grabbing it without asking permission first?~ [m#amb335]
@8166 = ~Hey! I wish you would show me more respect than that!~ [m#amb336]
@8167 = ~(Immediately after you have grabbed yourself a good handful of Amber's rear end, she spins around and grabs your buttocks in turn, returning the favour.)~
@8168 = ~If you really are *that* eager to get a hold of me, why don't we just camp early today?~ [m#amb337]
@8169 = ~You're nuts, did you know that? (Despite the disdainful tone of her reply, the barely veiled smile playing around Amber’s eyes and lips hints at the fact that she is actually rather taken by your comment.)~ [m#amb338]
@8170 = ~You have *no* idea of how sensual I can be if I really make an effort...~ [m#amb339]
@8171 = ~Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, <CHARNAME>... And I always thought there was something funny in *my* eyes. (Amber smiles wryly.)~ [m#amb340]
@8172 = ~You just wait for tonight, and I will show you just how sensual I can be.~ [m#amb341]
@8173 = ~Eeh-heh hee!~ [m#amb342]
@8174 = ~Aww, hah-hah!~ [m#amb343]
@8175 = ~Heh-heeh!~ [m#amb344]
@8176 = ~Aah-hah!~ [m#amb345]
@8177 = ~(Amber twitches away from you, covering her ear with her delicate hand.)~
@8178 = ~That tickles!~ [m#amb346]
@8179 = ~Eww... please don't do that.~ [m#amb347]
@8180 = ~Why did you do that? I really don't like it, you know.~ [m#amb348]
@8181 = ~Stop that!~ [m#amb349]
@8182 = ~(As soon as you congratulate yourself on catching Amber unawares, your suspicions - among other things - are aroused when you notice her very carefully avoiding looking at you and ever so slightly shifting her position to give you a better view.)~
@8183 = ~If you have business with me, I would that you'd rather take it up with my face instead of my breasts!~ [m#amb350]
@8184 = ~(Amber almost pokes your eye out when pointing her finger at your face, trying to force your attention from her neckline to her face. Fortunately, the fact that she looks ever so cute when angry more than makes up for the close call.)~
@8185 = ~(Amber is certainly not the most generously endowed lady you have ever met, but you find the view more than pleasing nevertheless. It is a pity that she prefers to wear such modest and practical clothes - as tight fitting as they are, you cannot help wishing that she would consider something a tad more feminine. Your mouth waters as you imagine her in a dress of gossamer thin Calimshite silk...)~
@8186 = ~(Your daydreams are suddenly interrupted as you realise that their subject is standing in front of you and waving her hand in front of your eyes.) Hey, you there? Stop dreaming and let's move on. You have this quest to solve, remember?~ [m#amb351]
@8187 = ~Are you sure you wouldn't want to do more than just look, dear?~ [m#amb352]
@8188 = ~(You can feel the muscles on Amber's arm tense as your fingers touch her skin.)~
@8189 = ~I am sorry, I did not mean to startle you. I was just admiring the shape of those markings you have on your arm.~
@8190 = ~Hey, no need to get jumpy, Amber. I was just admiring the shape of those markings you have on your arm.~
@8191 = ~It's all right... I guess I have been slightly on edge lately. It is good to know that you are here with me.~ [m#amb353]
@8192 = ~Oh, is that so? I really don't see anything special about them.~ [m#amb354]
@8193 = ~(There is a series of small figures circling the back of Amber's neck that remind you of the spots on a leopard. You cannot help wondering how far down the spots go after disappearing beneath her bodice.~
@8194 = ~You reach out and touch the spots at the nape of her neck. Amber shivers a little when you brush her warm skin with your fingers.)~
@8195 = ~(You try to follow all the twists and curls of a particularly complicated shape on Amber's arm only to realise that it is a hopeless task. Every time you think you have finally traced the whole figure, there always seems to be a new turn to explore.)~
@8196 = ~(You trace your fingers lightly along a pattern starting from behind Amber's ear and curving down to her cleavage. The figure disappears beneath the neckline of her bodice and you can only imagine where it might end. You feel Amber tremble with anticipation as you gently run your hand down the side of her breast.)~
@8197 = ~(With one gracious movement, you take a hold of Amber's hand and lean in to kiss it.)~
@8198 = ~(Courteously bow over her hand, but don't touch it with your lips.)~
@8199 = ~(Briefly brush your lips across the back of Amber’s hand.) ~
@8200 = ~(Place a tender, lingering kiss on the back of Amber's hand.)~
@8201 = ~(Turn Amber's hand around and kiss the palm of her hand.)~
@8202 = ~(Lick Amber's fingers.)~
@8203 = ~(Just smile and let go of Amber's hand.)~
@8204 = ~(Briefly brush your lips across the back of Amber’s hand.)~
@8205 = ~(Amber frowns slightly at your gesture.) That's, um... Very poetic of you, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb355]
@8206 = ~(A tiny burst of laughter escapes Amber's lips.) <CHARNAME>, you really are the sweetest.~ [m#amb356]
@8207 = ~My, aren't you bashful today. It really doesn't suit you too well, you know... Why don't you just do it like you mean it?~ [m#amb357]
@8208 = ~That's sweet, <CHARNAME>, but don't you think that we're already past such knight-in-shining-armour gestures?~ [m#amb358]
@8209 = ~Please, don't! My hands are dirty.~ [m#amb359]
@8210 = ~(A strange expression passes over Amber's face when you bring her hand to your lips, a mixture of curiosity and anxiety.)~
@8211 = ~Mmmm... That was over soon. Rather too soon, don't you think?~ [m#amb360]
@8212 = ~(You hear Amber gasp as you take your sweet time delivering the kiss. She looks a little flushed afterwards.)~
@8213 = ~My, aren't you thorough today. I'm counting on you to keep it up.~ [m#amb361]
@8214 = ~Now, if I could just have the same delivered here. (Smiling, Amber takes your hand and slowly brushes your fingers across her lips.)~ [m#amb362]
@8215 = ~A novel approach, <CHARNAME>. I wonder if you're as creative in other areas...~ [m#amb363]
@8216 = ~And I thought you were going to tell me my fortune, <CHARNAME>. I guess even I enjoy being wrong sometimes.~ [m#amb364]
@8217 = ~Eow! What are you doing, <CHARNAME>!? Now I've got your slobber all over my fingers!~
@8218 = ~Hah-ha! That tickles! Stop! My hands are probably not clean enough for you to want to do that anyway.~
@8219 = ~(Amber simply raises her eyebrow as you gently lick and nibble at her long, delicate fingers.)~
@8220 = ~(To your surprise, Amber blushes like a young maiden. You wonder what exactly was she thinking that conjured such a rosy colour on her cheeks.)~
@8221 = ~(Amber simply returns your smile.)~
@8222 = ~(As you try to let go of Amber's hand, it becomes obvious that she's not ready to let you go anywhere and insistently holds your hand for just a moment longer.)~
@8223 = ~(Amber looks slightly disappointed, as if she was waiting for you to do something.)~
@8224 = ~Was that really all, <CHARNAME>?~ [m#amb367]
@8225 = ~(You place a quick kiss on her cheek. Amber starts as your lips touch her face, but her surprise almost instantly melts into a gentle smile.)~
@8226 = ~Mmm... what did I deserve that for?~ [m#amb368]
@8227 = ~(You reach out to brush Amber's cheek with you fingers, but just as you touch her skin, something drives you to lean in and kiss her on the lips. You expect her to bolt away or perhaps even slap you, but instead you find yourself caught off guard when Amber leans in to respond to your kiss. Afraid of having misunderstood your intentions, Amber turns away, blushing.)~
@8228 = ~(You lean towards Amber in order to graze her forehead with your lips, but before you manage to reach her, Amber moves away from you.)~
@8229 = ~I-I don't think that is... ummm... necessary right now.~ [m#amb369]
@8230 = ~(Amber walks away, but there is no sign of displeasure on her face, just a slight, worried frown between her brows.)~
@8231 = ~(You sneak up behind Amber, planning to steal a kiss from her. Unfortunately for you, she feels your breath on her sensitive neck, spins around - poised for attack - and accidentally hits the side of your face with her elbow.)~
@8232 = ~Oh, it was you, <CHARNAME>. Don't sneak up on me like that, all right? You might hurt yourself.~ [m#amb370]
@8233 = ~(As if to offset her somewhat brisk tone of voice, Amber reaches out to plant a soft kiss on your cheek before turning and walking away. Her lips feel warm and soft, leaving you wishing for more.)~
@8234 = ~(You plant a light but tender kiss on Amber's lips. She beams at you and rests her head on your shoulder for a moment.)~
@8235 = ~(You take Amber into your arms and place a loving kiss on the top of her head. Breathing in her sweet scent, you hold Amber really, really close.)~
@8236 = ~(You press your mouth on Amber's inviting lips, which are already slightly parted as if waiting for your kiss. For one long moment, the world around you disappears and all you can sense is the intoxicating scent of her skin and the taste of her lips on yours. Reluctantly you draw yourself back into the surrounding reality and turn back to the task at hand.)~
@8237 = ~(Amber wraps her arms around your neck as you lean in to kiss her and slides her long fingers into your hair. As your lips meet, she presses her body tightly against yours and draws you into kiss like you have never had before. After you finally release each other from the passionate exchange, your head is spinning and your heart is racing with excitement.)~
@8238 = ~(For a heartbeat, Amber seems to hesitate in her response to your kiss, but when she decides to give in, your heart skips a beat from the sheer intensity of her passion. As she runs her hands down your sides and pulls you nearer by your hips, you feel a surge of desire flow through your body in response to her touch.)~
@8239 = ~(Unable to keep your hands away from her, you wrap them tightly around her slender body. In the heat of your passion, you hold on to her as if your life depended on it, but when you realise that she is not going anywhere and there is no way you can feel all of her at once, you allow her some room to breathe again and concentrate on caressing her in a more gentle manner.)~
@8240 = ~(A soft gasp escapes Amber's lips when you finally break the liplock. Her cheeks are flushed, her breath is heavy, and there is a look in her eyes that tells you in no uncertain terms just how much she appreciated your touch.)~
@8241 = ~(Deciding to do it *properly*, you place your right hand firmly at the lower end of Amber's spine and your left hand at the nape of her neck. Just as you prepare to bend Amber backwards, you are interrupted by a most unsettling giggle on Amber's part.)~
@8242 = ~Come on <CHARNAME>, we are not on a stage!~ [m#amb371]
@8243 = ~(Distracted and off balance, you hesitate for a second. Amber seizes the opportunity and deftly turns the tables on you. She literally jumps on you, wrapping her legs around your waist and her arms around your neck. Apparently satisfied with her control of the situation from this position, she proceeds to kiss the living daylights out of you.)~
@8244 = ~Do not think that I do not appreciate the effort, though... ~ [m#amb372]
@8245 = ~A game of riddles, you say? Very well, but I'll begin, if you don't mind. Would you like to have an easy one or a hard one?~ [m#amb373]
@8246 = ~I think I should probably try one of easier ones.~
@8247 = ~A hard one. Do your worst.~
@8248 = ~Actually, I have changed my mind. I am not in a mood for riddles after all.~
@8249 = ~All right, an easy one it shall be, then:~
@8250 = ~What goes best with bread?~
@8251 = ~What sort of a riddle is that? How am I supposed to know what *you* like with your bread?~
@8252 = ~Well, the answer is... (Try to distract Amber.)~
@8253 = ~Cheese?~
@8254 = ~Ham?~
@8255 = ~Butter?~
@8256 = ~Hunger, of course. If you're hungry enough, you need nothing to accompany your bread and it still tastes heavenly.~
@8257 = ~Hunger?~
@8258 = ~As you wish. This is a classic puzzle and an easy one to boot:~
@8259 = ~A white cover with gold inside;
  A heart of gold in a hut of white.~
@8260 = ~That does not even begin to make any sense to me. How am I supposed to figure out something like that?~
@8261 = ~Well, the answer is... (Distract Amber.)~
@8262 = ~A mountain?~
@8263 = ~An eye?~
@8264 = ~An egg?~
@8265 = ~A maiden?~
@8266 = ~Yes, that was easy one: the answer is an egg. You are not losing on purpose, are you?~
@8267 = ~And that's what you'll get. I learned this one from a good friend a long time ago:~
@8268 = ~The wave, over the wave, a weird thing I saw,
  through-wrought, and wonderfully ornate:
  a wonder on the wave - water became bone.~
@8269 = ~Is that supposed to be a riddle? Sounds more like a poem to me.~
@8270 = ~Ice?~
@8271 = ~A dolphin?~
@8272 = ~Coral?~
@8273 = ~A ship?~
@8274 = ~Ice, the answer is ice.~
@8275 = ~This would not necessarily be easy for a common man, but considering your background, you should have no trouble figuring it out.~
@8276 = ~I heard of a wonder, of words moth-eaten;
  that is a strange thing, I thought, weird
  that a man's song be swallowed by a worm,
  his binded sentences, his bedside stand-by
  rustled in the night - and the robber guest
  not one whit the wiser for the words he had mumbled.~
@8277 = ~A liar?~
@8278 = ~A wizard?~
@8279 = ~A bookworm?~
@8280 = ~Time?~
@8281 = ~A bookworm. As you probably guessed, I become quite familiar with them in Candlekeep.~
@8282 = ~All right, this one is a bit more difficult:~
@8283 = ~Their dark bodies, dun-coated,
  when the breeze bears them up over the backs of the hills
  are black, diminutive.~
@8284 = ~Bold singers
  they go in companies, call out loudly;
  they tread the timbered cliff, and at times the eaves
  of men's houses.~
@8285 = ~How do they call themselves?~
@8286 = ~Wolves?~
@8287 = ~A rainstorm?~
@8288 = ~Crows?~
@8289 = ~Bats?~
@8290 = ~Crows. I think I have heard this one before.~
@8291 = ~Well, you asked for it. This was one of Jill's favourites:~
@8292 = ~I am puff-breasted, proud-crested,
  a head I have, and a high tail,
  eyes and ears and one foot,
  both my sides, a back that's hollow,
  a very stout beak, a steeple neck
  and a home above men.~
@8293 = ~Harsh are my sufferings
  when that which makes the forest tremble takes and shakes me.
  Here I stand under streaming rain
  and blinding sleet, stoned by hail;
  freezes the frost and falls the snow
  on me stuck-bellied. And I stick it all out
  for I cannot change the chance that made me.~
@8294 = ~A horse?~
@8295 = ~A flag?~
@8296 = ~It's a weathercock, of course.~
@8297 = ~A weathercock?~
@8298 = ~You'll never guess this one, <CHARNAME>:~
@8299 = ~When it is earth I tread, make tracks upon water
  or keep the houses, hushed is my clothing,
  clothing that can hoist me above house-ridges
  at times toss me into the tall heaven
  where the strong cloud-wind carries me on
  over cities and countries; accoutrements that
  throb out sound, thrilling strokes
  deep-soughing song, as I sail alone
  over field and flood, faring on,
  resting nowhere. My name is...~
@8300 = ~A cloud?~
@8301 = ~Breeze?~
@8302 = ~Rain?~
@8303 = ~A swan, and I did not have to guess that, Amber.~
@8304 = ~A swan?~
@8305 = ~Well, sink your teeth into this one:~
@8306 = ~Abandoned unborn by my begetters
  I was still dead a few spring days ago:
  no beat in the breast, no breath in me.~
@8307 = ~A kinswoman covered me in the clothes she wore,
  no kind but kind indeed. I was coddled and swaddled
  as close as I had been a baby of her own,
  until, as had been shaped, so shielded, though no kin,
  the unguessed guest grew great with life.~
@8308 = ~She fended for me, she fed me up,
  till I was of a size to set my bounds
  further afield. She had fewer dear
  sons and daughters because she did so.~
@8309 = ~A cuckoo?~
@8310 = ~A hurricane?~
@8311 = ~A bird's egg?~
@8312 = ~A disease?~
@8313 = ~A cuckoo. The mother cuckoo lays her egg in another bird's nest and the hatchling will push its stepmother's own young out of nest so that only the cuckoo will survive.~
@8314 = ~Come on! You're not even trying properly! (Amber puts her arms around you and smiles playfully.) Maybe I should encourage you a little?~ [m#amb374]
@8315 = ~(Not really sure of the answer, you decide to try and weasel your way out of the situation.)~
@8316 = ~(You grab Amber into your arms and bend her backwards while kissing her madly. At first she protests a little, but her muffled arguments soon turn to giggles.)~
@8317 = ~(You attempt to divert Amber's attention from the riddling game with a passionate kiss, but fail miserably when she avoids your lips and gently pushes you back.)~
@8318 = ~So, <CHARNAME>, do you know the answer or not?~ [m#amb375]
@8319 = ~Bah, I don't need to. This riddling game is silly anyway.~
@8320 = ~No, I suppose I don't.~
@8321 = ~(You summon the most seductive look that you can conjure on your face. Bending forward slightly, your eyes still locked into Amber's, you take her hand and place a soft kiss on her palm.)~
@8322 = ~Why don't we forget this game and concentrate on something more stimulating?~
@8323 = ~(Place another kiss on her wrist and work your way up from there.)~
@8324 = ~(Amber laughs softly.) All right, I see that your mind is occupied by something entirely different than answering riddles.~ [m#amb376]
@8325 = ~(You pretend to see something interesting behind Amber, and before she realises that she has just fallen for the oldest trick in the book, you grab the disoriented tiefling in your arms. A massive bear hug distracts her just enough to make her forget about the riddles. At least for the moment.)~
@8326 = ~No, it is not! (A triumphant smile plays on Amber's lips as she draws closer to you.) Did we already agree on a prize for the winner? No?~ [m#amb377]
@8327 = ~Well, that would leave you in rather unfortunate position, wouldn't it; completely under my mercy. I'll have to ponder on this... What should I ask you to do *tonight*?~ [m#amb378]
@8328 = ~Oh, but I know! A smile on those sweet lips of yours would satisfy my demands.~ [m#amb379]
@8329 = ~(Smile at her.)~
@8330 = ~(Turn and walk away.)~
@8331 = ~A kiss would be a suitable prize for my victory, if you would be kind enough to grant me that small favour.~ [m#amb380]
@8332 = ~(Dutifully kiss Amber as briefly as possible.)~
@8333 = ~(Kiss Amber passionately.)~
@8334 = ~I will have to give this some serious thinking. Let's just say that I will get back to you when I know what I *want* from you.~ [m#amb381]
@8335 = ~That's correct!~ [m#amb382]
@8336 = ~Very well, the winner should get his due. (Amber wraps her slender arms around your neck and gives you a deep, lingering kiss. You feel a little dizzy afterwards.)~ [m#amb383]
@8337 = ~I'm impressed. I like men to have their brain where it ought to be, you know. (Amber brushes her fingers through your hair and smiles sweetly.)~ [m#amb384]
@8338 = ~I'm impressed. I like men to have their brain where it ought to be, you know. (Amber brushes her fingers across your smooth pate and smiles sweetly.)~ [m#amb384]
@8339 = ~You're not bad at all with riddles, I see. That is definitely something I can appreciate.~ [m#amb385]
@8340 = ~I wonder what sort of a prize would please our winner today? I shall have to think of something special just for you, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb386]
@8341 = ~(The flickering torchlight reflecting off Amber's hair reminds you of the warm rays of the sun. Even under Adalon's spell, there is a hint of pale gold in her otherwise bleak silvery-white hair.)~
@8342 = ~(The flickering torchlight reflecting off Amber's hair reminds you of the warm rays of the sun. Like a shimmering cascade of fire, her hair falls off her shoulders and flows down her back.)~
@8343 = ~(Amber looks tense, and you see a worried frown between her eyebrows. Even though she hides it well, the dark shadows under her eyes betray the fact that she has not been sleeping too well lately. As weary as she may be, you do not see the slightest lapse in her constant alertness.)~
@8344 = ~(You watch Amber move from shadow to shadow without making the slightest of noises. You don't recall her ever making much noise, not even in environments most people would consider safe. However, in the endless tunnels of the Underdark, her subterfuge seems to take on a whole new level as she makes her way among the rocks and stalagmites, nothing more than a shadow herself.)~
@8345 = ~Don't waste your time looking at me, <CHARNAME>. You really can't afford to let your guard down in this place.~ [m#amb387]
@8346 = ~(You flash Amber an encouraging smile, but she's too busy keeping her eyes on the surrounding darkness to notice you.)~
@8347 = ~(Amber returns your smile with one so brief that you wonder if she really smiled at you or whether it was just the flickering torchlight fooling your eyes.)~
@8348 = ~(You catch Amber's eyes briefly as she smiles nervously back at you. Quickly she turns her gaze away, as if afraid that her eyes could betray how frightened she really is.)~
@8349 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Your smile makes me miss the stars a little less.~ [m#amb388]
@8350 = ~No, I'd better not... I think it would be best to keep our hands on our weapons.~ [m#amb389]
@8351 = ~(You see an expression of relief cross Amber's face as you take her hand. She squeezes your hand gently.)~
@8352 = ~Your hands are cold, <CHARNAME>. Are you all right?~ [m#amb390]
@8353 = ~I'm fine. I was just wondering how you were doing.~
@8354 = ~I just miss the warm rays of the sun, that's all.~
@8355 = ~I'm doing fine, I guess, considering the circumstances.~
@8356 = ~As well as can be expected under these circumstances, I guess. Thank you for asking, though.~ [m#amb391]
@8357 = ~Bizarrely enough, so do I. Not as much as I miss the stars, though.~ [m#amb392]
@8358 = ~I'm glad to hear that you're not ready to give in just yet.~ [m#amb393]
@8359 = ~(The moment your fingertips touch the back of Amber's hand, she snatches her hand away and turns her back to you.)~
@8360 = ~Don't! I need full use of my arms right now. There are monsters about, and we stand little chance against them if we are all tangled up with each other.~ [m#amb394]
@8361 = ~(Amber's already tense muscles stiffen even more as you put your arm around her.) I - I don't think this is a very good time for such gestures, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb395]
@8362 = ~(Amber pushes your arm away quite determinedly.)~
@8363 = ~(A barely noticeable sigh of relief escapes Amber's lips as you embrace her. She does not rest her head on your shoulder, though.)~
@8364 = ~(When you take Amber into your arms, you can feel just how tense she is. Even in the safety of your embrace, she does not relax for a moment, but instead tries to peek over your shoulder in order to keep an eye on the surrounding shadows.)~
@8365 = ~I'm glad that you're here with me, <CHARNAME>. I don't usually mind being alone, but here... I would hate to be here alone.~ [m#amb396]
@8366 = ~I'm fine. You should not worry so much, <CHARNAME>.~ [m#amb397]
@8367 = ~And I'm here to protect *you*. (Something resembling a smile briefly replaces the worried frown on Amber's face.)~ [m#amb398]
@8368 = ~I don't need you to protect me, <CHARNAME>. You just take care of yourself.~ [m#amb399]
@8369 = ~Yeah, right. What is it that you want now?~
@8370 = ~Okay... I take it that you are not saying that just to be nice. You might just as well tell me if you want me to do something.~
@8371 = ~Thank you, it is very nice of you to say so.~
@8372 = ~Oh, thank you, <CHARNAME>. You are not that bad a travelling companion yourself.~
@8373 = ~I'm not scared. Just being careful, that's all.~
@8374 = ~Only a fool would not feel uneasy here. I'm glad that you can admit it.~
@8375 = ~Well, thank you. But, I'm not *that* scared, you know.~
@8376 = ~I... I just hope that we get out of here in one piece. With you around that might even be possible.~
@8377 = ~Don't pretend to understand when you obviously don't. ~
@8378 = ~Only a fool would not feel uneasy here. I'm glad that you can see that.~
@8379 = ~Well, it wasn't just me, as you well know, <CHARNAME>. It could have been any one of us, but thank you for your kind words.~
@8380 = ~Any one of us could have done it, given the opportunity that I got. So there's no need to get all flustered about it, <CHARNAME>.~
@8381 = ~Well, that's pretty much what I figured when I got the chance to finish her. Just make sure that she's staked real good. Wouldn't want to do it all over again, you know.~
@8382 = ~As unpleasant as he and his doings might have been, I really don't think he was all he was made up to be. I've seen worse.~
@8383 = ~Well, as much as I would like to claim its head as my personal trophy, I don't think I would have stood a chance alone. Besides, I don't even have a fireplace to hang it over.~
@8384 = ~A nasty bugger it was, but I'm just glad that there's now one nasty bugger less in this world.~
@8385 = ~I've never much enjoyed putting nails on anybody's coffin, but I suppose that particular cambion did deserve to get wasted.~
@8386 = ~(Amber seems a little surprised that you actually think of asking her something like that.)~
@8387 = ~The way you treat people, I really don't see why you even bother asking.~
@8388 = ~I'm okay, I guess... ~
@8389 = ~I'm doing well. It was kind of you to ask, <CHARNAME>.~
@8390 = ~Not so good, actually. Don't ask me why, but I have a feeling that something bad is about to happen.~
@8391 = ~Seeing that ship there in the middle of the city gives me the shivers. And not just because it's on dry land, either.~
@8392 = ~I'm doing just fine, although I kind of miss seeing the stars at night. It would be nice to sleep under the open sky again.~
@8393 = ~Well, I guess I'm doing fine, except for my back which aches like crazy. Don't you think it would be nice to sleep in a proper bed for a change?~
@8394 = ~I'm not really sure how I feel. This all so very new to me... You know, this thing with you and I.~
@8395 = ~I guess I just need some reassurance that this is really going to work.~
@8396 = ~I don't know. I have this strange craving to see the ocean and to feel its smell. I don't really know why, since I don't think water is really my element.~
@8397 = ~You don't need to be concerned about me right now, <CHARNAME>. Catching up with Irenicus is much more important and we should focus all our energies on that.~
