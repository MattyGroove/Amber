There she only barely escaped an angry mob with the help of a young bard called Jill. As she speaks warmly of Jill and respectfully of the bard's brother Tristan, Amber's expression lightens somewhat. You can clearly understand that the two girls were close, but there is sadness in her eyes that tells you that her friend is long gone. As Amber's story goes on, you begin to wonder how old this exotic creature really is. She has visited lands so far away - from the frozen north to the heat of the southern deserts, travelled years with a circus group and yet her face betrays no signs of age. When you try to ask her about her age, she responds that it does not matter as the people around her never change, no matter how much time passes by. Prejudices die hard if ever.~

Another line of tinkering led to the integration of magic with spears.  Tribal shaman would enchant the spears so that they would hit more often and do greater damage to their wielder's opponents.
This particular spear is consists of an ashen shaft and a sharpened head that bears the look of dwarven craftsmanship. It is interesting to note that although the head, and likely the shaft as well, seem to be of dwarven manufacture, the enchanted runes on both the shaft and the head are carved in elvish letters. A work such as this, the product of the combined efforts of two peoples, is a very uncommon thing. This simple, yet effective weapon is a rare testament to the potential held by such an alliance.

"The device seems to be working flawlessly and there are no obvious glitches in the process. Now I will only have to find specimens worthy of the effort, since all of my test specimens have given out only dull browns and grays. I suspect that this is a result of a cross-contamination between their various mundane and uninteresting emotions and desires. It would seem that satisfactory results would demand specimens that are either sufficiently single-minded (preferably possessing extreme emotions or urges) or in some other manner unadulterated."

"Ah ha, success at last. I have at last produced the first specimen worth keeping. The subject was a human male in his early thirties, characterised by an extraordinarily single-minded obsession with murder. Judging from the reports of my hunters, he had caused quite a bloodbath before my men caught him. With him, the result was a deep, bluish black hue with only the slightest of impurities. In the future I will give out orders to concentrate on similar obsessive anomalies in different varieties."

"I seem to have hit upon another success. My hypothesis seems to have been correct; an obsession in fire in the specimen manifested itself in a deep, flickering red - very pleasing. Other colours may prove more difficult, but this is turning out to be a very amusing exercise of my imagination."

"It seems that pure colours are harder to come by than I would have imagined; people seem to be less imaginative and passionate than I would like. I'm beginning to doubt that I will ever manage to collect the full spectrum, or that one even exists on this plane. Creatures of the elemental planes could prove of use here; I will need to look into it."

"It seems that fortune is not entirely against me. Through a windfall quite unrelated to the present endeavour, I have managed to enlarge my collection with a rather handsome sample of a deep forest-green hue. The colour is most probably due to the arboreal habitat and upbringing of the sample, with the freshness of the sample contributing the flawless quality of the result. I will have to do some more experimentation on these fresh samples."

"The pattern I surmised seems stronger by every new experiment. Today I managed to create a specimen of very pure white hue; there were practically no blemishes and the colour is a beautiful milky white. The subject was a newborn, only minutes old. I kept his mother on hand until she went into labour; the specimen was practically delivered directly into the device and I doubt it possible to obtain any cleaner results with the technology currently available." 

"It seems that I have more or less exhausted this avenue of research; there are only so many pure colours. Besides, my mind has of late been fascinated by the thought of combining different colours and textures. On a theoretical level, the best way to go about this would probably be to acquire natural hybrids, in which two or more distinct and preferably powerful essences appear together in a single sample. Analysing these samples and the resultant products would probably give clues as to the best way of artificially combining essences."

"My informants have finally reported of a suitable hybrid specimen. Their reports indicate that a demon hybrid, commonly referred to as a "tiefling", has recently been released from the city jail. They have managed to locate the creature and I have instructed them to acquire it at the first convenient opportunity. I will have to remember to clean and calibrate by equipment; it is imperative that the results of the first tentative sample be as reliable as possible."

"The creature is finally in my possession. I have to say that I am slightly disappointed; the creature is a mere human with only slight visible signs of demonic taint. A true half-breed could have been more interesting, but I am confident that even the slight taint will manifest itself somehow in the result. In order to avoid any stress-induced alterations to her psyche, I have accommodated the creature as I would a guest instead of holding it as a prisoner. As soon as I get the equipment prepared, I will proceed to take the necessary samples and administer the tests."~
@294  = ~This handsome tome seems to be a journal of some kind. The entries within are not clearly dated and you are not certain whether they are ordered chronologically or otherwise. The following entries manage to attract your interest:

"The device seems to be working flawlessly and there are no obvious glitches in the process. Now I will only have to find specimens worthy of the effort, since all of my test specimens have given out only dull browns and grays. I suspect that this is a result of a cross-contamination between their various mundane and uninteresting emotions and desires. It would seem that satisfactory results would demand specimens that are either sufficiently single-minded (preferably possessing extreme emotions or urges) or in some other manner unadulterated."

"Ah ha, success at last. I have at last produced the first specimen worth keeping. The subject was a human male in his early thirties, characterised by an extraordinarily single-minded obsession with murder. Judging from the reports of my hunters, he had caused quite a bloodbath before my men caught him. With him, the result was a deep, bluish black hue with only the slightest of impurities. In the future I will give out orders to concentrate on similar obsessive anomalies in different varieties."

"I seem to have hit upon another success. My hypothesis seems to have been correct; the specimen's obsession with fire manifested itself in a deep, flickering red - very pleasing. Other colours may prove more difficult, but this is turning out to be a very amusing exercise of my imagination."

"It seems that pure colours are harder to come by than I would have imagined; people seem to be less imaginative and passionate than I would like. I'm beginning to doubt that I will ever manage to collect the full spectrum, or that one even exists on this plane. Creatures of the elemental planes could prove of use here; I will need to look into it."

"It seems that fortune is not entirely against me. Through a windfall quite unrelated to the present endeavour, I have managed to enlarge my collection with a rather handsome sample of a deep forest-green hue. The colour is most probably due to the arboreal habitat and upbringing of the sample, with the freshness of the sample contributing the flawless quality of the result. I will have to do some more experimentation on these fresh samples."

"The pattern I surmised seems stronger with every new experiment. Today I managed to create a specimen of very pure white hue; there were practically no blemishes and the colour is a beautiful milky white. The subject was a newborn, only minutes old. I kept his mother on hand until she went into labour; the specimen was practically delivered directly into the device and I doubt it possible to obtain any cleaner results with the technology currently available." 

"It seems that I have more or less exhausted this avenue of research; there are only so many pure colours. Besides, my mind has of late been fascinated by the thought of combining different colours and textures. On a theoretical level, the best way to go about this would probably be to acquire natural hybrids, in which two or more distinct and preferably powerful essences appear together in a single sample. Analysing these samples and the resultant products would probably give clues as to the best way of artificially combining essences."

I have another extraction assignment that needs to be taken care of. The individual in question is a female demi-human who goes by the name of 'Amber'. She was recently released from the Athkatlan jail where she was held by the Cowled Wizards for being a deviant. According to my sources, she should be of slight build, have a rather tan complexion with tattooed markings on her body and a long, fiery-red hair. She may be accompanied by a party of ruffians with regards to whom you are free to act as you please. This assignment is of utter importance, so you should put your best men to the task. When you have located her, I will send my men to wait for her at your headquarters. Do not disappoint me like your predecessor did.
